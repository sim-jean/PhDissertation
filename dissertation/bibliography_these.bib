	abstract = {Climate strongly influences global wildfire activity, and recent wildfire surges may signal fire weather-induced pyrogeographic shifts. Here we use three daily global climate data sets and three fire danger indices to develop a simple annual metric of fire weather season length, and map spatio-temporal trends from 1979 to 2013. We show that fire weather seasons have lengthened across 29.6 million km2 (25.3\%) of the Earth’s vegetated surface, resulting in an 18.7\% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also show a doubling (108.1\% increase) of global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons ({\textgreater}1.0 σ above the historical mean) and an increased global frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.4 million km2 (53.4\%) during the second half of the study period. If these fire weather changes are coupled with ignition sources and available fuel, they could markedly impact global ecosystems, societies, economies and climate.},

abstract = {This study considers a class of critical node detection problems that involves minimization of a distance-based connectivity measure of a given unweighted graph via the removal of a subset of nodes (referred to as critical nodes) subject to a budgetary constraint. The distance-based connectivity measure of a graph is assumed to be a function of the actual pairwise distances between nodes in the remaining graph (e.g., graph efficiency, Harary index, characteristic path length, residual closeness) rather than simply whether nodes are connected or not, a typical assumption in the literature. We derive linear integer programming (IP) formulations, along with additional enhancements, aimed at improving the performance of standard solvers. For handling larger instances, we develop an effective exact algorithm that iteratively solves a series of simpler IPs to obtain an optimal solution for the original problem. The edge-weighted generalization is also considered, which results in some interesting implications for distance-based clique relaxations, namely, -clubs. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments with real-world and randomly generated network instances under various settings that reveal interesting insights and demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. In particular, one important conclusion of our work is that vulnerability of real-world networks to targeted attacks can be significantly more pronounced than what can be estimated by centrality-based heuristic methods commonly used in the literature. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

When sites cannot all be protected immediately, and excluded sites are threatened by development, planning should factor in both expected biodiversity benefits of sites and development risk. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic integer-programming problem. We find that the timing of selections is critical; conservation budgets available up front yield significantly greater biodiversity protection. We also compare results using optimal and heuristic algorithms. The theory is applied to vertebrate and development threat data from southwestern California.},

@article{Elith2009,
   abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

@article{EpanchinNiell2014,
   abstract = {Wood borers and bark beetles are among the most serious forest pests worldwide. Many such species have become successful invaders, often causing substantial, costly damages to forests. Here we design and evaluate the cost-efficiency of a trap-based surveillance program for early detection of wood borers and bark beetles at risk of establishing in New Zealand. Although costly, a surveillance program could lead to earlier detection of newly established forest pests, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful eradication and reducing control costs and damages from future invasions. We develop a mechanistic bioeconomic model that relates surveillance intensity (i.e., trap density) and invasion size to probabilities of detection and control. It captures the dynamics of invasive species establishment, spread, and damages to urban and plantation forests. We employ the model to design surveillance programs that provide the greatest net present benefits. Our findings suggest that implementing a surveillance trapping program for invasive wood borers and bark beetles would provide positive net benefits under all scenarios considered. The economically optimal trapping strategy calls for a very high investment in surveillance: about 10 000 traps in each year of the 30-year surveillance program, at a present value cost of US\$54 million. This strategy provides a 39\% reduction in costs compared with no surveillance, corresponding to an expected net present benefit of approximately US
   \$300 million. Although surveillance may provide the greatest net benefits when implemented at relatively high levels, our findings also show that even low levels of surveillance are worthwhile: the economic benefits from surveillance more than offset the rising costs associated with increasing trapping density. Our results also show that the cost-efficiency of surveillance varies across target regions because of differences in pest introduction and damage accumulation rates across locales, with greater surveillance warranted in areas closer to at-risk, high-value resources and in areas that receive more imported goods that serve as an invasion pathway.},

The appropriate unit for both benefit and cost functions is the likelihood of survival and the appropriate question is how certain we want to be of species survival. The intensity of the species preservation debate is also fired by strong equity concerns. We illustrate these points for the case of the northern spotted owl by constructing a marginal cost curve for its survival and by disaggregating welfare loss by region and by market level.},

   abstract = {It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quantization schemes for 2b quanta, b = 1,2, ···, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes. ©1982 IEEE},

   abstract = {The k-means algorithm is well known for its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. In this paper we present two algorithms which extend the k-means algorithm to categorical domains and domains with mixed numeric and categorical values. The k-modes algorithm uses a simple matching dissimilarity measure to deal with categorical objects, replaces the means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. With these extensions the k-modes algorithm enables the clustering of categorical data in a fashion similar to k-means. The k-prototypes algorithm, through the definition of a combined dissimilarity measure, further integrates the k-means and k-modes algorithms to allow for clustering objects described by mixed numeric and categorical attributes. We use the well known soybean disease and credit approval data sets to demonstrate the clustering performance of the two algorithms. Our experiments on two real world data sets with half a million objects each show that the two algorithms are efficient when clustering large data sets, which is critical to data mining applications.},

   abstract = {Partitional clustering of categorical data is normally performed by using K-modes clustering algorithm, which works well for large datasets. Even though the design and implementation of K-modes algorithm is simple and efficient, it has the pitfall of randomly choosing the initial cluster centers for invoking every new execution that may lead to non-repeatable clustering results. This paper addresses the randomized center initialization problem of K-modes algorithm by proposing a cluster center initialization algorithm. The proposed algorithm performs multiple clustering of the data based on attribute values in different attributes and yields deterministic modes that are to be used as initial cluster centers. In the paper, we propose a new method for selecting the most relevant attributes, namely Prominent attributes, compare it with another existing method to find Significant attributes for unsupervised learning, and perform multiple clustering of data to find initial cluster centers. The proposed algorithm ensures fixed initial cluster centers and thus repeatable clustering results. The worst-case time complexity of the proposed algorithm is log-linear to the number of data objects. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on several categorical datasets and compared it against random initialization and two other initialization methods, and show that the proposed method performs better in terms of accuracy and time complexity. The initial cluster centers computed by the proposed approach are close to the actual cluster centers of the different data we tested, which leads to faster convergence of K-modes clustering algorithm in conjunction to better clustering results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the performance of K-modes clustering is especially sensitive to the selection of initial cluster centers. Therefore, choosing the proper initial cluster centers is a key step for K-modes clustering. In this paper, we consider the initialization of K-modes clustering from the view of outlier detection. We present two different initialization algorithms for K-modes clustering, where the first is based on the traditional distance-based outlier detection technique, and the second is based on the partition entropy-based outlier detection technique. By using the above two outlier detection techniques to calculate the degree of outlierness of each object, our algorithms can guarantee that the chosen initial cluster centers are not outliers. Moreover, during the process of initialization, we adopt a new distance metric - weighted matching distance metric, to calculate the distance between two objects described by categorical attributes. Experimental results on several UCI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our initialization algorithms for K-modes clustering.},

The performance of k-states is compared to other two procedures in both a simulation study and an empirical application. In the former, k-states displays a better accuracy in reconstructing knowledge structures; in the latter, the structure extracted by k-states obtained a better fit.},

   abstract = {Land and natural resource conservation programs are increasingly being evaluated on the basis of their return on investment (ROI). Conservation ROI analysis quantitatively measures the costs, benefits, and risks of investments, which allows conservation organizations to rank or prioritize them. This article surveys the literature in this area. We organize our discussion around the way studies treat the core elements of ROI, which include the definition and measurement of the conservation objective, identification of relevant baselines, the types of conservation investments considered, and investment costs. We discuss the state of the art of ROI analysis, highlight some unresolved issues, and make suggestions for improvements. We also describe options for extending ROI analysis beyond biodiversity conservation, which is the typical objective. The literature indicates that conservation planning that uses ROI analysis can considerably alter the location and targets of conservation, lead to more protection and higher quality conservation outcomes, and result in significant savings. The measurement and prediction of baseline ecological conditions and threats remains a central challenge for conservation ROI analysis, as does accounting for landowner and developer responses to conservation investments. Another key priority for future research is the identification of ways to more comprehensively incorporate ecosystem services and multiple environmental objectives into the assessment framework},

   abstract = {This article examines the use of economic analysis to inform bioinvasion management, with particular focus on forest resources. Economics is key for understanding invasion processes, impacts, and decision-making. Biological invasions are driven by and affect economic activities at multiple scales and stages of an invasion. Bioeconomic modeling seeks to inform how resources can be optimally allocated across invasion management activities—including prevention, surveillance programs for early detection and management, and controlling invasion populations and spread—to minimize the long-term costs and damages. Economic analysis facilitates understanding of decisions by public and private decision-makers, gaps between these, and the design of policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes. Private decision-makers may undercontrol invasions relative to socially optimal levels, because they generally account for their own costs and benefits of control but less often for broader ecosystem impacts or future spread across the landscape. Economic analysis considers approaches for increasing private invasion management and evaluates feedbacks between ecological and economic systems that can affect policy outcomes. Future research should continue evaluation and design of control strategies across the biosecurity continuum and across species to enhance cost-effectiveness, better incorporate uncertainty into policy design, increase focus on incentives and behavioral tools to influence private behaviors that affect invasion spread, and incorporate invasive species consideration within broader systems-focused science. In addition, challenges in valuing biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts and the costs and effectiveness of control measures are key data gaps. Greater collaboration between decision-makers and researchers will facilitate development and communication of usable economic research.},

   abstract = {Bio-economic modelling has become a useful tool for anticipating the outcomes of policies and technologies before their implementation. Advances in mathematical programming have made it possible to build more comprehensive models. In an overview of recent studies about bio-economic models applied to land-use problems in agriculture and forestry, we evaluated how aspects such as uncertainty, multiple objective functions, system dynamics and time have been incorporated into models. We found that single objective models were more frequently applied at the farm level, while multiple objective modelling has been applied to meet concerns at the landscape level. Among the objectives, social aspects are seldom represented in all models, when being compared to economic and environmental aspects. The integration of uncertainty is occasionally a topic, while stochastic approaches are more frequently applied than non-stochastic robust methods. Most multiple-objective models do not integrate uncertainty or sequential decision making. Static approaches continue to be more recurrent than truly dynamic models. Even though integrating multiple aspects may enhance our understanding of a system; it involves a tradeoff between complexity and robustness of the results obtained. Land-use models have to address this balance between complexity and robustness in order to evolve towards robust multiple-objective spatial optimization as a prerequisite to achieve sustainability goals.},

   abstract = {Much effort in systematic conservation planning has gone into devising measures and algorithms which are efficient at capturing the biological importance of different candidate areas. While cost is at the theoretical heart of complementarity based analyses, little empirical attention has been paid to explicitly incorporating cost into conservation planning. Here we begin to address this gap by utilising the first estimate of management costs for ecoregion conservation across the entire African continent to examine the consequences of incorporating estimates of management costs into conservation planning. We apply a recently developed equation linking empirical costs data to economic indicators and the size distribution of reserves to estimate the annual funding required to effectively manage reserve networks covering 10\% of each of Africa's 118 ecoregions. Our estimates suggest that US\$630 M/ year (0.1\% of African Gross National Income) would achieve this goal. However, within this the costs per ecoregion vary widely. Analysis of this variation in cost emphasises that high costs are likely to be correlated with high endemism or threat and that focussing exclusively on cheap areas is unlikely to achieve conservation goals. We also used the cost estimates to examine the potential for improving cost-effectiveness in conservation planning by comparing cumulative representation of vertebrate species and the associated management cost of reserves under different prioritisation schemes where cost was included or excluded. We found that factoring the cost of conservation management into the planning process results in a marked increase in the cost effectiveness of a given prioritisation scheme. This suggests that further improvements in systematic conservation planning are more likely to come more from measuring and integrating cost and other socio-economic considerations than from focusing exclusively on refinement of biological criteria.},

   abstract = {Invasions by non-indigenous plant species pose serious economic threats to Australian agricultural industries. When a new invader is identified a rapid response is critical, particularly if the invasive species has the ability to spread rapidly. An early decision is required whether to attempt to eradicate or contain the infestation, or do nothing and leave it to landholders to manage. These decisions should be based on economic considerations that account for long term benefits and costs. This paper describes a bioeconomic simulation framework with a mathematical model representing weed spread linked to a dynamic programming model to provide a means of determining the economically optimal weed management strategies over time, from the government's perspective. The modelling framework is used to evaluate hypothetical case study invasive weed control scenarios in the Australian cropping systems. The benefit-cost ratios of invasion control are shown to be generally very high and clearly, there are significant benefits to be achieved by controlling highly invasive weeds when initial infestations are at a low level. Even if the invasion cannot be eradicated due to its high invasiveness or budget constraints, it still pays to maintain invasions at low levels. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

   abstract = {A density-dependent matrix model of stand growth is presented. The model was calibrated with re-measured plots in the northern hardwood forests in Wisconsin. Trees were divided into shade-tolerant, intermediate, and shade-intolerant species in twelve diameter classes. Model predictions were tested against post-sample observations for short-term (15-year) and long-term (steady-state) accuracy. This growth model was then applied to study stand growth dynamics with and without management. Starting with the current average stand state, the predicted stand basal area of an unmanaged stand rose steadily to a maximum, dropped gradually, and finally reached a steady state. The time paths of basal area and tree size diversity were highly and positively correlated. Instead, tree species diversity decreased when size diversity and basal area increased, and vice-versa. When harvesting was introduced, it was found that more intensive harvest increased the diversity of tree species, while decreasing the diversity of tree size. A 20-year cutting cycle could produce higher economic returns than a 10-year cutting cycle, with similar size and species diversity. Harvesting most of the saw timbers every 20 years could be a good compromise between economics and tree diversity, at the stand level.},

   abstract = {1. There are very few general guidelines available to improve the process of eradicating invasive species. We addressed the basic question of whether it is more efficient to prioritize the removal of outliers or core populations of an invasive grass, Spartina alterniflora. 2. We used a structured model in which the population of the invasive species is partitioned into different classes based on local conspecific density in order to investigate density-based eradication strategies. 3. The Spartina population at a Pacific coast estuary in Washington state, USA, is subject to an Allee effect: at low density plants produce fewer propagules than in high-density coalesced meadows. Plants at low density, however, are able to spread faster vegetatively. We used a genetic algorithm to find the optimal division of resources between removal of high-density and low-density plants. We explored the consequences of the Allee effect, contrasting financial budgets available for control operations and the inclusion of seedling control in addition to the control of mature plants. 4. We found that the optimal strategy was dependent on the annual budget available for control. At low and medium budgets, it was necessary to remove the low-density plants first to achieve eradication, but if more money was available then the optimal strategy was to prioritize high-density areas. 5. Without an Allee effect the optimal strategy would always be to prioritize the removal of fast-growing, low-density sub-populations. Seedling control did not change the optimal strategy but did, in some cases, reduce the cost of eradication. 6. Synthesis and applications. Given the uncertainty in future budgets allocated for control of invasive Spartina , we recommend a strategy that prioritizes the removal of low-density subpopulations of S. alterniflora over high-density subpopulations. The Allee effect in this system is not sufficiently strong to outweigh the importance of the rapid vegetative spread of the plants at low density.},

Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclusions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social–ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social–ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

The model considers that migration is a collective behavior socio-economically driven and that the ecosystem is dynamic. The model identifies equilibria that vary from mass migration, farmland abandonment, and forest regeneration, to no migration and forest eradication; partial migration and/or coexistence of farmland and forest also constitute possible equilibria. Overall, the model reflects farmland abandonment processes observed in the field and illustrates the importance of the complex interlinked mechanisms between the social and ecological systems determining farmland abandonment, that are not evident when approached independently. The model dynamics show that the hysteresis on the social dynamics renders regimes shifts difficult to reverse, and that this difficulty is accentuated when considering the ecological system dynamic. Similar models could be applied to other socio-ecological systems to help their management.},

   abstract = {Understanding niche evolution, dynamics, and the response of species to climate change requires knowledge of the determinants of the environmental niche and species range limits. Mean values of climatic variables are often used in such analyses. In contrast, the increasing frequency of climate extremes suggests the importance of understanding their additional influence on range limits. Here, we assess how measures representing climate extremes (i.e., interannual variability in climate parameters) explain and predict spatial patterns of 11 tree species in Switzerland. We find clear, although comparably small, improvement (+20\% in adjusted D2, +8\% and +3\% in cross-validated True Skill Statistic and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values) in models that use measures of extremes in addition to means. The primary effect of including information on climate extremes is a correction of local overprediction and underprediction. Our results demonstrate that measures of climate extremes are important for understanding the climatic limits of tree species and assessing species niche characteristics. The inclusion of climate variability likely will improve models of species range limits under future conditions, where changes in mean climate and increased variability are expected.},

The resulting integration encounters various data, methodological, and analytical problems, especially those concerning aggregation and inference, land-use pixel links, data and measurement, and remote sensing analysis.

In the first half of the twentieth century, natural resource economics was firmly in Pinchot’s side of that schism. That position began to change as the postwar environmental movement gained momentum. In particular, John Krutilla, an economist at Resources for the Future, pushed economics to the point that it could embrace Muir’s vision as well as Pinchot’s.

   abstract = {Increased efforts are required to prevent further losses to terrestrial biodiversity and the ecosystem services that it  provides1,2. Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50\%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy. To promote the recovery of the currently declining global trends in terrestrial biodiversity, increases in both the extent of land under conservation management and the sustainability of the global food system from farm to fork are required.},

We evaluated uncertainty arising from differences in model formulations of tree response to climate change based on a rigorous intercomparison of projections of tree distributions in France. We compared eight models ranging from niche-based to process-based models. On average, models project large range contractions of temperate tree species in lowlands due to climate change. There was substantial disagreement between models for temperate broadleaf deciduous tree species, but differences in the capacity of models to account for rising CO 2 impacts explained much of the disagreement. There was good quantitative agreement among models concerning the range contractions for Scots pine. For the dominant Mediterranean tree species, Holm oak, all models foresee substantial range expansion. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

   abstract = {Today, more than ever, robust projections of potential species range shifts are needed to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Such projections are so far provided almost exclusively by correlative species distribution models (correlative SDMs). However, concerns regarding the reliability of their predictive power are growing and several authors call for the development of process-based SDMs. Still, each of these methods presents strengths and weakness which have to be estimated if they are to be reliably used by decision makers. In this study we compare projections of three different SDMs (STASH, LPJ and PHENOFIT) that lie in the continuum between correlative models and process-based models for the current distribution of three major European tree species, Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus robur L. and Pinus sylvestris L. We compare the consistency of the model simulations using an innovative comparison map profile method, integrating local and multi-scale comparisons. The three models simulate relatively accurately the current distribution of the three species. The process-based model performs almost as well as the correlative model, although parameters of the former are not fitted to the observed species distributions. According to our simulations, species range limits are triggered, at the European scale, by establishment and survival through processes primarily related to phenology and resistance to abiotic stress rather than to growth efficiency. The accuracy of projections of the hybrid and process-based model could however be improved by integrating a more realistic representation of the species resistance to water stress for instance, advocating for pursuing efforts to understand and formulate explicitly the impact of climatic conditions and variations on these processes.},

   abstract = {Forest management requires prediction of forest growth, but there is no general agreement about which models best predict growth, how to quantify model parameters, and how to assess the uncertainty of model predictions. In this paper, we show how Bayesian calibration (BC), Bayesian model comparison (BMC) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) can help address these issues.We used six models, ranging from simple parameter-sparse models to complex process-based models: 3PG, 4C, ANAFORE, BASFOR, BRIDGING and FORMIND. For each model, the initial degree of uncertainty about parameter values was expressed in a prior probability distribution. Inventory data for Scots pine on tree height and diameter, with estimates of measurement uncertainty, were assembled for twelve sites, from four countries: Austria, Belgium, Estonia and Finland. From each country, we used data from two sites of the National Forest Inventories (NFIs), and one Permanent Sample Plot (PSP). The models were calibrated using the NFI-data and tested against the PSP-data. Calibration was done both per country and for all countries simultaneously, thus yielding country-specific and generic parameter distributions. We assessed model performance by sampling from prior and posterior distributions and comparing the growth predictions of these samples to the observations at the PSPs.We found that BC reduced uncertainties strongly in all but the most complex model. Surprisingly, country-specific BC did not lead to clearly better within-country predictions than generic BC. BMC identified the BRIDGING model, which is of intermediate complexity, as the most plausible model before calibration, with 4C taking its place after calibration. In this BMC, model plausibility was quantified as the relative probability of a model being correct given the information in the PSP-data. We discuss how the method of model initialisation affects model performance. Finally, we show how BMA affords a robust way of predicting forest growth that accounts for both parametric and model structural uncertainty. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In the model there are two agents: a park agency managing a national park of fixed size and a group of agropastoralists living in the vicinity of the park. The park authority produces tourism services and sells hunting licences, whereas the agropastoralists produce livestock products. Wildlife and livestock interact with each other and wildlife is a nuisance for livestock production. The conflict is analysed under different market solutions as the agropastoralists, to various degrees, are given profit shares from the park activities. It is demonstrated that a market solution where they are given property rights in the form of a fixed share of the harvesting profit, will increase the nuisance on their production and therefore generally give no clear welfare gain for the local people. On the other hand, if they also receive a profit share from the tourist activity above that of the hunting benefit, the nuisance from the roaming wildlife will decrease as this scheme gives incentives for the park manager to increase the offtake and thereby decrease the wildlife stock in the long term. There will therefore be more livestock and a clear welfare gain for the agropastoralists compared to the situation where they have no property rights. Under certain conditions, the stock sizes will also be closer to what is optimal from an overall point of view.},

   abstract = {Invasive pests cross property boundaries. Property managers may have private incentives to control invasive species despite not having sufficient incentive to fully internalize the external costs of their role in spreading the invasion. Each property manager has a right to future use of his own property, but his property may abut others' properties enabling spread of an invasive species. The incentives for a foresighted property manager to control invasive species have received little attention. We consider the efforts of a foresighted property manager who has rights to future use of a property and has the ability to engage in repeated, discrete control activities. We find that higher rates of dispersal, associated with proximity to neighboring properties, reduce the private incentives for control. Controlling species at one location provides incentives to control at a neighboring location. Control at neighboring locations are strategic complements and coupled with spatial heterogeneity lead to a weaker-link public good problem, in which each property owner is unable to fully appropriate the benefits of his own control activity. Future-use rights and private costs suggest that there is scope for a series of Coase-like exchanges to internalize much of the costs associated with species invasion. Pigouvian taxes on invasive species potentially have qualitatively perverse behavioral effects. A tax with a strong income effect (e.g., failure of effective revenue recycling) can reduce the value of property assets and diminish the incentive to manage insects on one's own property.},

The prevailing planning paradigm is to identify the minimum land allocations needed to reach specified conservation targets or maximize the amount of conservation accomplished under an area or budget constraint. We propose a more general formulation for setting conservation priorities that involves goal setting, assessing the current conservation system, developing a scenario of future biodiversity given the current conservation system, and allocating available conservation funds to alter that scenario so as to maximize future biodiversity. Under this new formulation for setting conservation priorities, the value of a site depends on resource quality, threats to resource quality, and costs. This planning approach is designed to support collaborative processes and negotiation among competing interest groups.

   abstract = {In agricultural landscapes, climate change has profound impacts on species that society aims to conserve. In response to climate change, species may adapt spatially (with range shifts) and temporally (with phenological adaptations), which may make formerly effective conservation sites and measures less effective. As climate change also has an impact on yields, opportunity costs of land use-based conservation measures may also change spatially and with respect to the timing of conservation measures. Due to these spatio-temporal modifications of the costs of conservation measures and their impacts on species, formerly cost-effective conservation sites and measures may no longer be so in a changing climate. We combine ecological-economic modelling with climate science to investigate climate change-induced modifications of the timing and spatial allocation of cost-effective conservation measures. We apply our model to the case study of conserving the large marsh grasshopper on agricultural grasslands in the German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. Comparing the periods 2020-2039 and 2060-2079, our model indeed indicates that climate change induces modifications in the cost-effective spatial allocation of conservation measures and that measures which are adapted to phenological changes remain cost-effective under climate change.

It is shown, using examples for northern hardwood stands in Wisconsin, that both problems can be solved via mathematical programming techniques. The programming approaches utilize a set of nonlinear equation models for stand table projections which consider the interdependence of size classes within the stand. To illustrate procedures, optimal stand structures are found for a case where initial stand basal area is constrained to specified levels and the objective is to maximize value growth over the cutting cycle. A conversion cutting schedule is then determined for a case in which the objective is maximization of present worth. It is emphasized that both the optimal distribution and conversion problems can be generalized to consider a broad range of objective functions, lengths of cutting cycle, and constraints on the growing stock.

The model ascertains tiger population dynamics under several management scenarios. Steady-state convergence is observed under secure property rights for the Soligas.

   abstract = {The optimal harvesting policy for a plant-herbivore system consisting of lichen and reindeer in Finnish Lapland is investigated. Using a discrete time model with no age structure it is shown that the optimal procedure to reach target levels for lichen and reindeer involves a possible initial harvest of reindeer and then a sequence of no-harvesting years until the lichen has recovered. After two adjusting harvests the system will settle to an equilibrium. The optimal solution is compared with the fastest possible approach to the target levels. The two solutions coincide if future yields are sufficiently discounted. With a discount factor near one there will be a heavier initial harvest in the optimal solution. It is seen that allowing some harvesting also in the no-harvesting years has no marked effect on the total yield. The target levels for lichen and reindeer are not unique but depend both on discounting and on the length of the planning period.},

They also support the concept of long cyclic changes in natural stands, gradually approaching a climax state. Shortcomings of the data are that they do not come from an experimental design, they are not always accurate, and they must be supplemented with other information, especially concerning mortality.

It is found that the optimal harvesting rule can be expressed as a function of lichen biomass only. The deterministic and stochastic solutions differ in three ways. Firstly, monality risk of the reindeer increases the discount rate. This results in a heavier use of the lichen resources and consequently the optimal target lichen biomass is in the stochastic model lower than in the deterministic case. Secondly, when the current lichen biomass is below the optimal target level, during lichen recovery more reindeer are left alive in the stochastic model, in order to avoid overharvesting the reindeer population. Thirdly, if the amount of lichen is greater than the optimal biomass value, more animals can be left alive in the deterministic model in order to reduce the lichen biomass back to the optimal value.},

Applying the modelling procedure enables us to focus on two aspects that hitherto have been neglected in analysing the impact of organic farming on biodiversity. (1) Possible differences in the timing of land use between organic and conventional farming, and (2) differences in the uptake of agri-environment schemes (AES) by organic and conventional farmers. We found that for the species considered the difference in the impact of conventional and organic farming is minor, because in our case study region the timing of land use on most areas with organic farming is very similar to the timing on areas with conventional farming. We also found that in comparison with conventional farmers, organic farmers generally face lower opportunity costs when implementing AES measures. Additionally, organic farmers are offered lower payments for such measures. These factors influence organic farmers’ decisions to take part in AES, which in turn has an important impact on biodiversity conservation. In order to better conserve species it may be necessary to adapt the payment structure of AES with respect to organic farming.},

   abstract = {Abstract: Biodiversity loss in farmlands is widely documented, and agriculture intensification has been identified as a main driver of this decline. Numerous agri-environmental policies have been implemented to assess the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. However, most published studies focus on land-use scenarios, thus neglecting the economic dimension. We develop a bio-economic spatially explicit modelling across 620 small French agricultural areas, which couples a public decision maker under budgetary constraint, regional economic agents in a context of uncertainty and breeding bird dynamics. Using dynamic models, we analyse the direct impacts of several current economic scenarios of the Common Agriculture Policy on common bird communities through five ecological indicators, all related to breeding populations of birds in farmlands: the farmland bird index (FBI), a generalist bird index (GBI), the Shannon diversity index, a community specialization index (CSI) and a community trophic index (CTI). We consider these indicators to scan various functional traits of bird communities. Trends in the different indicators are significantly contrasted pending on economic policy scenarios. Scenarios promoting intensive crops lead to small but specialized communities with more granivorous species, hence a low trophic level for the community. By contrast, promoting extensive grasslands increases the population size, enhances high trophic level but decreases community specialization. Evaluation of agricultural policies should not rely on a single indicator per taxonomic group. In the context of potential reversal of current bird declines, bio-economic modelling, involving farmland incomes, is proposed as a relevant support for decision making about sustainable agri-environmental policies. Promoting extensive grasslands is essential for the sustainable management of bird communities and agriculture. We, however, reveal more complex economic effects and synergies between public incentives, which appear to give interesting leverage for enhancing the bio-economic effectiveness of agricultural policies.},

The objective of this paper is to give insights into the impact of public policies on both conservation of biodiversity and farming production. We develop a macro-regional model combining community dynamics of 34 bird species impacted by agricultural land-uses and an economic decision model. The ecological dynamic model is calibrated with the STOC (French Breeding Bird Survey) and AGRESTE (French land-uses) databases while the economic model relies on the gross margins of the FADN (Farm Accountancy Data Network). We investigate the scenario based on subsidies and taxes. We show that simple economic instruments could be used to establish scenarios promoting economic performances and bird populations. It is pointed out how the sustainability of the policies is sensitive to the ecological and economic indicators used by the planner. The bio-economical analysis shows several solutions for the ecology-economy trade-off.

To date, few optimality models have been presented to optimize this trade-off, especially when the common currency cannot be easily measured in dollars. We use a population simulation model (e.g. spatially explicit individual-based model) to model a hypothetical forest bird population's response to different cutting and planting regimes. We then link these results to a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal choice a manager should make at each time step to minimize revenue foregone by not harvesting timber while maintaining a given population of birds. Our results show that if optimal management choices are made further back in time, future (terminal) reward may be greater. As the end of the management period approaches, past management practices influence the terminal reward more than future practices can. Thus if past revenue lost is high, the future reward will be low as compared to when past revenue lost is low. The general strategy of setting some minimum viable population size and then using a population simulator linked to a dynamic programming model to ask how to maintain such a population size with minimum economic loss should have nearly universal applicability in conservation biology.},

We show that a penalty which varies with the output of a poacher is, in theory, a more effective tool against poaching than a fixed penalty. However, the probability of capture is a highly significant factor in the poacher's decision to hunt. 3. The incentives to poach are modelled for an open access situation, the industry structure for a local poacher, and for a monopolist who employs organized gangs. Organized and local gangs have very different reactions to law enforcement. Local poachers will respond to local investment schemes, but the deterrence of organized gangs can only be achieved with improved law enforcement operations.},

All non-commercial trees would remain, and thus contribute to diversity and carbon storage. The best policy to maximise carbon storage was not to cut at all. This also maximised diversity, by leading to a forest in its climax state. However, this policy had a very high opportunity cost. Compromise policies were obtained, for example by maximising carbon storage, or diversity, while getting a competitive rate of return on the capital in trees. Findings suggest that increasing carbon storage and tree diversity can be attained only at significant costs in terms of foregone income.

For this purpose, a non-linear matrix model of stand growth was estimated from re- measured stands, and the predictions compared with actual data. Then, long- term simulations were used to determine the effects of (i) extracting some mortality only; (ii) applying Susmel's (1980) management guides; (iii) cutting only trees above a diameter limit, (iv) saving the beech, and (v) continuing the current harvest rate. The ecological criteria to evaluate the different management regimes were basal area and stand composition by tree species and size. The economic criterion was the net present value of the harvests. The results suggest that, for a 10-year cutting cycle, applying Susmel's guide or a diameter-limit cut of 70 cm for conifers and 50 for beech would keep diversity of species and size equal to that of an unmanaged stand, though lowering basal area. Of the two, Susmel's guide would give 25\% higher income. However, income could be doubled by lowering the diameter-limit cut to 60 cm for conifers and 45 for beech. This would give the same basal area and species diversity, but decrease size diversity by about 6\%. The policy that did not allow to cut beech resulted in stands that had less beech than those obtained by Susmel's guide or diameter-limit cuts. Perpetuating the current cutting rate gave the highest tree size diversity, but lower species diversity and the lowest income. Of cutting cycles of 5, 10. and 15 years, the longest gave, other things being equal, the highest basal area and size diversity, slightly lower species diversity, but substantially lower income.},

The parameters were based on species-dependent equations linking individual tree growth, mortality, and stand recruitment to tree and stand characteristics, including stand diversity in terms of tree species and size. The equations were estimated with individual tree and stand data from 2706 permanent plots in western Washington and Oregon, largely from private and state lands, measured twice at an average interval of 10 years. Other things being equal, diameter growth increased slightly with species diversity and decreased with size diversity. Recruitment increased with species diversity and decreased with size diversity. Mortality was independent of species diversity and tended to increase with size diversity. There was practically no relationship between individual tree volume and species or size diversity. The number of trees predicted by the model over the interval between successive inventories was generally unbiased. Long-term predictions with different initial conditions were consistent with standard yield tables and compared favorably with those of the Forest Vegetation Simulator.

This study specifies such a model and shows how even-aged management follows endogenously and reveals what factors work in favor of each management alternative. Numerical analysis shows that even- and uneven-aged systems may represent locally optimal solutions and may yield equal economic outcomes.

The solution technique is a derivative-free, coordinate-search process called the method of Hooke and Jeeves. The optimizer incorporates without modification the Stand Prognosis Model, a single-tree simulator that is used extensively in the western United States. This paper focuses on sensitivity analysis and performance of the optimizer on problems with both short and long time horizons and with different definitions of the harvest controls. Superior harvest regimes are found by defining harvest controls with relatively wide diameter-class boundaries and with broad species groups. In all cases examined, there is variability in present value and harvest pattern associated with the choice of the starting point for the optimizer. The cause of these multiple optima is a nonconvex and discontinuous response surface produced by the single-tree simulator. This points out the need to examine the results from several random starts before making conclusions about optimal timber harvesting.},

   abstract = {The uneven-aged management problem is to determine the management regime for an existing stand over an infinite time horizon, without ever clearcutting it. A new solution method to solve this problem is presented and demonstrated on simulated Norway spruce stands with different initial stand structures. Diameter distributions were used as a convenient way to describe these structures. The method, which puts much effort into determining the timing of harvest activities, is based on Tabu search and greedy heuristics. The growth dynamics were described with a single tree simulator. Different problem approaches for this problem were adopted to maximize the net present value (NPV) of harvested trees, with or without steady-state constraints. With no such constraints, a finite time horizon approximates the general management problem, while the steady-state constraints involved fixed and equilibrium endpoints. The fixed endpoint was a reverse J-shaped diameter distribution, and its purpose was to mimic the structure of a virgin stand. Analysis of economic efficiency, productivity, and managerial implications were made. With the method used and for the endpoint problems, the conversion strategy, conversion length, and steady-state diameter distribution were determined simultaneously. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov measure was used to describe the similarity between diameter distributions and was put directly into the constraints. The infinite approximation is suggested as the best problem formulation as it, in contrast to a steady-state approach, does not assume that a resource system reaches a climax, eliminates the need to define a diameter class width, and involves no fixed cutting cycles. The even-aged management problem, which is to determine the best period for clearcutting and the best thinning regime that precedes the clearcut, while recognizing the soil expectation value, was analyzed for comparison. The method is flexible, independent of the kind of growth simulator used, and can, for example, be directly applied to a diameter class model.},

The prevailing planning paradigm is to identify the minimum land allocations needed to reach specified conservation targets or maximize the amount of conservation accomplished under an area or budget constraint. We propose a more general formulation for setting conservation priorities that involves goal setting, assessing the current conservation system, developing a scenario of future biodiversity given the current conservation system, and allocating available conservation funds to alter that scenario so as to maximize future biodiversity. Under this new formulation for setting conservation priorities, the value of a site depends on resource quality, threats to resource quality, and costs. This planning approach is designed to support collaborative processes and negotiation among competing interest groups. We demonstrate these ideas with a case study of the Sierra Nevada bioregion of California.},

Although many conservation priory-setting frameworks used by NGO's or public agencies explicitly claim to emphasize efficiency or wise investment, none actually incorporates costs in a formal return-on-investment (ROI) framework. We illustrate here how an ROI framework can be applied to real world resource allocation decisions faced by conservation organizations. We present two examples: (1) allocating resources to purchase land in 21 ecoregions that make up the Temperate Forest Habitat in the US; (2) allocating resources among a variety of conservation actions (not just land purchase) in Mediterranean habitats, with rates of habitat loss factored into the analysis. An important feature of both case studies is that costs vary by orders of magnitude, depending on where or how one is doing conservation. Second, because costs and biodiversity are not well correlated, enormous savings are possible by applying an ROI analysis. Moreover, recommended priorities after including costs in the calculations often deviate substantially from priorities based solely on biodiversity measures. Hence we argue that a major effort of conservationist biologists should be to include and record the costs of conservation actions. If serious attention is not given to returns on investment, it implies that "money is no object.".},

Results from the case study show that, without an effective conservation scheme that at least fences fragments, significant plant biodiversity losses will occur in the North East Wheatbelt Regional Organisation of Councils region of the WA wheatbelt over a 10-year period. A perfect price discriminating auction scheme could reduce the costs of conservation by around 17 per cent relative to a fixed-payment scheme; however, a fixed payment on outcome (measured as change in the species metric) scheme represents a viable second-best alternative, to a conservation auction, where conservation spending is spatially targeted.},

   abstract = {Decision makers involved in land acquisition and protection often have multiple conservation objectives and are uncertain about the occurrence of species or other features in candidate sites. Models informing decisions on selection of sites for reserves need to provide information about cost-efficient trade-offs between objectives and account for incidence uncertainty. We describe a site selection model with two important conservation objectives: maximize expected number of species represented, and maximize the likelihood that a subset of endangered species is represented. The model uses probabilistic species occurrence data in a linear-integer formulation solvable with commercial software. The model is illustrated using probabilistic occurrence data for 403 terrestrial vertebrates in 147 candidate sites in western Oregon, USA. The trade-offs between objectives are explicitly measured by incrementally varying the threshold probability for endangered species representation and recording the change in expected number of species represented. For instance, in the example presented here, we found that under most budget constraints, the probability of representing three endangered species can be increased from 0.00 (i.e., no guaranteed protection) to 0.90 while reducing expected species representation 2\%. However, further increasing the probability of endangered species representation from 0.90 to 0.99 results in a much larger reduction in species representation of 14\%. Although the numerical results from our analysis are specific to the species and area studied, the methodology is general and applicable elsewhere.},

   abstract = {Conservation funds are grossly inadequate to address the plight of threatened species. Government and conservation organizations faced with the task of conserving threatened species desperately need simple strategies for allocating limited resources. The academic literature dedicated to systematic priority setting usually recommends ranking species on several criteria, including level of endangerment and metrics of species value such as evolutionary distinctiveness, ecological importance, and social significance. These approaches ignore 2 crucial factors: the cost of management and the likelihood that the management will succeed. These oversights will result in misallocation of scarce conservation resources and possibly unnecessary losses. We devised a project prioritization protocol (PPP) to optimize resource allocation among New Zealand's threatened-species projects, where costs, benefits (including species values), and the likelihood of management success were considered simultaneously. We compared the number of species managed and the expected benefits gained with 5 prioritization criteria: PPP with weightings based on species value; PPP with species weighted equally; management costs; species value; and threat status. We found that the rational use of cost and success information substantially increased the number of species managed, and prioritizing management projects according to species value or threat status in isolation was inefficient and resulted in fewer species managed. In addition, we found a clear trade-off between funding management of a greater number of the most cost-efficient and least risky projects and funding fewer projects to manage the species of higher value. Specifically, 11 of 32 species projects could be funded if projects were weighted by species value compared with 16 projects if projects were not weighted. This highlights the value of a transparent decision-making process, which enables a careful consideration of trade-offs. The use of PPP can substantially improve conservation outcomes for threatened species by increasing efficiency and ensuring transparency of management decisions.},

At the global scale, the availability of biodiversity maps is increasing, but analogous maps for economic factors that affect biodiversity conservation are rare, and no study has examined global conservation planning at high resolution using both biodiversity and cost information. Here, we integrate spatial information on crop productivity, livestock density, and prices to produce a global map of the gross economic rents from agricultural lands. We then illustrate the importance of including such opportunity costs in global planning for the conservation of endemic vertebrate species. Plans that consider costs represent endemic species at 10-33\% of the opportunity cost of plans that do not, and produce priority sets that diverge from existing schemes. Given scarce resources and the great cost-effectiveness of plans that consider both biodiversity and costs, mapping of the economic costs of conservation should receive similar levels of research attention as mapping of biodiversity.},

   abstract = {Failing to account for uncertainty in the detection of invasive plants may lead to inefficient management strategies and wasted resources. Smart strategies to manage plant invasions requires consideration of the economic costs and benefits, and plant life-history characteristics as well as imperfect detection. 2.We develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to provide optimal management actions when we are uncertain about the presence of invasive plants. The optimal strategy depends on the probability of being in a particular state. We ask the question, 'When is it preferable to use a less efficient, less costly action to a more efficient, more costly action?' We apply the POMDP to branched broomrape Orobanche ramosa, a parasitic plant species at the centre of a national eradication campaign in South Australia. 3.The optimal strategy depends on the ability to detect the invasive species and the location of the infested site. For high detection rates, if the site is a satellite infestation, management should employ the more efficient, more costly action (i.e. soil fumigation) the year the weed is detected followed by monitoring. When the detection probability is low, then it is optimal to employ the less efficient, low cost action (i.e. host denial) in the years the species is not detected. For sites in the centre of the infestation, management should employ the less costly, less efficient action. While the optimal strategy is insensitive to colonization, the likelihood of local eradication diminishes as colonization probability increases, highlighting the importance of limiting colonization if eradication is to be achieved. 4.Synthesis and applications.Providing decision support for managing ecological systems is a key role of applied research. Formulating this support within a decision theory context provides a framework for good decision-making. The POMDP model is a novel decision support tool for optimal sequential decision making when invasive plants are difficult to detect. The model can determine the best management action to employ based on the location of the infestation and can inform when to switch to alternative management actions that buffer against imperfect detection.},

For many invasions the development of socially optimal control strategies requires more than is offered by the single-species, single-control models that have dominated this area of research. We develop a general stochastic optimal control framework that accommodates multiple interacting species while accounting for uncertainty in the temporal population dynamics. This extension to the current line of bioeconomic control models allows for the design of optimal integrated pest management strategies that utilize both chemical and biological controls in an environment of uncertainty and irreversibility. We demonstrate the benefits of combining chemical and biological controls in long term management strategies through a case study of the hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) infestation in the eastern United States. In this application we find that the introduction of natural predators is usually sufficient to manage the infestation, though chemical insecticides can play an important role when detection of the infestation is delayed or when the biological control agent does not sufficiently increase mortality of the invasive species.},

   abstract = {Abstract Invasive species are a worldwide issue, both ecologically and economically. A large body of work focuses on various aspects of invasive species control, including how to allocate control efforts to eradicate an invasive population as cost effectively as possible. There are a diverse range of invasive species management problems, and past mathematical analyses generally focus on isolated examples, making it hard to identify and understand parallels between the different contexts. In this study, we use a single spatiotemporal model to tackle the problem of allocating control effort for invasive species when suppressing an island invasive species, and for long-term spatial suppression projects. Using feral cat suppression as an illustrative example, we identify the optimal resource allocation for island and mainland suppression projects. Our results demonstrate how using a single model to solve different problems reveals similar characteristics of the solutions in different scenarios. As well as illustrating the insights offered by linking problems through a spatiotemporal model, we also derive novel and practically applicable results for our case studies. For temporal suppression projects on islands, we find that lengthy projects are more cost effective and that rapid control projects are only economically cost effective when population growth rates are high or diminishing returns on control effort are low. When suppressing invasive species around conservation assets (e.g., national parks or exclusion fences), we find that the size of buffer zones should depend on the ratio of the species growth and spread rate.},

   abstract = {The external cost associated with the spread of pasture weeds such as serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) is an important economic problem. This problem is complicated in many parts of south-eastern Australia where low rainfall and low soil fertility prevent the economic viability of control of this weed through pasture improvement. A consequence of serrated tussock spread in this region has been calls for increased public intervention in its control. However, because there have been no attempts to measure the external costs of serrated tussock spread, one of the major economic grounds on which this activity might be justified has not been quantified. The purpose of this paper is to provide this information. A stochastic simulation model is developed to determine the size of the external cost associated with the spread of serrated tussock and to evaluate the economic benefits of a range of control scenarios. It is concluded that on low rainfall-low soil fertility country the socially optimal control option for serrated tussock is to retire land from agriculture and re-vegetate it with trees.},

   abstract = {Summary: The extensive impact of invasive species has motivated a growing field of research combining ecological and economic models to find cost-effective management strategies. Ecological systems are rarely perfectly observable, meaning decision-makers are usually uncertain about the current extent of an infestation and even whether an invasive species is present or absent. We show how to account for this uncertainty when providing decision support for invasive species management. We constructed the first partially observable model to analyse the trade-off between all three facets of invasive species management: quarantine, surveillance and control. We use a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to determine how to allocate resources between these actions when the extent of an invasion is uncertain. We use a case study of potential black rat Rattus rattus invasion on Barrow Island, Western Australia. Our model shows it is often better to manage based on an uncertain belief in species presence than to spend money trying to confirm the presence or absence through surveillance. While it was never optimal to invest solely in surveillance to reduce uncertainty, it was often optimal to combine surveillance with quarantine or control. These mixed strategies, where multiple actions are implemented simultaneously, were more often optimal than for similar decision models where the extent of the infestation is known, suggesting an element of risk spreading. Optimal investments in each action were driven by their estimated efficacy, and the difference in the estimated impact of a localized and widespread invasion. For example, in our case study, it was often optimal to invest solely in control due to the low estimated efficacy of quarantine and the relatively small impact of a localized incursion. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis shows that the cost of reducing uncertainty through surveillance is not always accompanied by an improvement in management outcomes. By carefully analysing the benefits of surveillance prior to implementation of invasive species management strategies, managers can avoid wasting resources and improve management outcomes.},

   abstract = {Economic growth is recognized as an important factor associated with species invasions. Consequently, there is increasing need to develop solutions that combine economics and ecology to inform invasive species management. We developed a model combining economic, ecological, and sociological factors to assess the degree to which economic policies can be used to control invasive plants. Because invasive plants often spread across numerous properties, we explored whether property owners should manage invaders cooperatively as a group by incorporating the negative effects of invader spread in management decisions (collective management) or independently, whereby the negative effects of invasive plant spread are ignored (independent management). Our modeling approach used a dynamic optimization framework, and we applied the model to invader spread using Linaria vulgaris. Model simulations allowed us to determine the optimal management strategy based on net benefits for a range of invader densities. We found that optimal management strategies varied as a function of initial plant densities. At low densities, net benefits were high for both collective and independent management to eradicate the invader, suggesting the importance of early detection and eradication. At moderate densities, collective management led to faster and more frequent invader eradication compared to independent management. When we used a financial penalty to ensure that independent properties were managed collectively, we found that the penalty would be most feasible when levied on a property's perimeter boundary to control spread among properties. At the highest densities, the optimal management strategy was "do nothing" because the economic costs of removal were too high relative to the benefits of removal. Spatial variation in L. vulgaris densities resulted in different optimal management strategies for neighboring properties, making a formal economic policy to encourage invasive species removal critical. To accomplish the management and enforcement of these economic policies, we discuss modification of existing agencies and infrastructure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis revealed that lowering the economic cost of invader removal would strongly increase the probability of invader eradication. Taken together, our results provide quantitative insight into management decisions and economic policy instruments that can encourage invasive species removal across a social landscape.},

   abstract = {Wood borers and bark beetles are among the most serious forest pests worldwide. Many such species have become successful invaders, often causing substantial, costly damages to forests. Here we design and evaluate the cost-efficiency of a trap-based surveillance program for early detection of wood borers and bark beetles at risk of establishing in New Zealand. Although costly, a surveillance program could lead to earlier detection of newly established forest pests, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful eradication and reducing control costs and damages from future invasions. We develop a mechanistic bioeconomic model that relates surveillance intensity (i.e., trap density) and invasion size to probabilities of detection and control. It captures the dynamics of invasive species establishment, spread, and damages to urban and plantation forests. We employ the model to design surveillance programs that provide the greatest net present benefits. Our findings suggest that implementing a surveillance trapping program for invasive wood borers and bark beetles would provide positive net benefits under all scenarios considered. The economically optimal trapping strategy calls for a very high investment in surveillance: about 10 000 traps in each year of the 30-year surveillance program, at a present value cost of US\$54 million. This strategy provides a 39\% reduction in costs compared with no surveillance, corresponding to an expected net present benefit of approximately US\$300 million. Although surveillance may provide the greatest net benefits when implemented at relatively high levels, our findings also show that even low levels of surveillance are worthwhile: the economic benefits from surveillance more than offset the rising costs associated with increasing trapping density. Our results also show that the cost-efficiency of surveillance varies across target regions because of differences in pest introduction and damage accumulation rates across locales, with greater surveillance warranted in areas closer to at-risk, high-value resources and in areas that receive more imported goods that serve as an invasion pathway.},

Much evidence now exists that documents island biodiversity impacts by invasive mammals. The technical ability to eradicate invasive mammals from islands has increased exponentially; consequently, strategic planning focused on maximizing the ROI is now a limiting factor for island restoration. We use a regional ROI approach to prioritize eradications on islands for seabird conservation in British Columbia, Canada. We do so by integrating economic costs of interventions and applying a resource allocation approach. We estimate the optimal set of islands for eradication under two conservation objectives each with a series of increasing thresholds of population sizes and breeding locations. Our approach (1) identified the most cost-effective interventions, (2) determined whether or not those interventions were nested with increasing thresholds, and (3) helped justify larger investments when appropriate. More often than not, conservation decisions are made at a regional scale, and decision-makers often must make choices on how to allocate funds across a number of potential conservation actions. A regional, ROI framework can serve as a decision-support tool for organizations engaging in discrete interventions in order to maximize benefits for the minimum cost.},

It is shown that reproduction and mortality characteristics of both species ands age structure of the invader at the time of invasion are important for the costs of invasions when the invader and resident species compete for scarce resources. Commercially harvested species with low juvenile survival and high reproduction are found to be economically more robust against invasions. Species with these life-history traits are also the most damaging as invaders. Properties of the harvesting cost function and the discount rate are shown to be of importance for the development of the invader population over time. Hence, it is possible to identify specific combinations of life-history characteristics and economic conditions under which invasions cause particularly large economic damage},

We develop a stylized model which frames the interaction of a representative largely unknown species, its habitat, and park visitors in an alpine ecosystem. In applying this to the protection of a rock partridge population in the Hohe Tauern National Park (Austria), we illustrate that a combined visitor and species protection policy can maximize steady state net benefits from tourism and conservation, while ensuring that the endangered species reaches its conservation target in the long run. Thus, even for a small, largely unknown species such as the rock partridge, and not only for popular species like the golden eagle, it is possible to endogenously generate a conservation budget by attracting visitors},

   abstract = {We present a bioeconomic model for moose Alces alces management in Norway, where two sub-populations of moose are subject to different site-specific mortality rates caused by the spatial distribution of territorial wolf Canis lupus packs, and are coupled by the seasonal migration of moose. The costs and benefits of moose are asymmetrically distributed in space, since they congregate in the wolf territory during winter where most browsing damage occurs. Using a class-structured matrix population model as the basis for bioeconomic analysis, we investigated how the optimal moose management differed between a unified (i.e. maximising overall profit) and a non-unified (i.e. profit maximised at the level of individual landowners) management scheme. Within the unified management scheme, the combined marginal costs and benefits decide the optimal off-take rate, and the relative hunting value and damage costs decide the relative allocation of the harvest between the two sub-populations. In the non-unified management scheme, harvesting takes place up to the point where the private marginal hunting value equals the private marginal browsing cost, while the relative hunting value and damage costs do not influence the optimal management. As the browsing damage that occurs inside the wolf territory is not taken into account in the costs of the area outside the territory within the non-unified solution, optimal moose population size will be higher for the outer area than under the unified solution. This results in an overall economic loss, which increases with increasing migration rates. Whenever the boundaries of political or management units do not follow those of ecological processes, ignoring the spatial resolution of the ecological process will result in sub-optimal management of a renewable resource.},

   abstract = {A model of weed control, which took into account the stochastic nature of crop price, yield, and weed density, was developed to assist farmers in determining weed densities that justify herbicide application and the optimal rate of application. In an application of cocklebur control in soybeans, it was found that the value of following the "if-then-else" treatment strategy versus a fixed application rate regardless of weed density was approximately \$25 per acre at low weed numbers. Profits of the marginal treatment strategy are higher than the "if-then-else" strategy, but may not be sufficient to cover the additional informational costs. Under both strategies, the total amount of herbicide applied decreases with increases in uncertainty under the assumption of risk neutrality. The result is due to the convex relationship between weed density and yield loss. Under the assumption of maximizing expected utility, there are instances in which herbicide use increases with risk aversion as per conventional wisdom.},

   abstract = {Unsustainable bushmeat hunting is a major threat to mammal species, particularly in West/Central Africa. We developed a multispecies dynamic simulation model of hunter behaviour, parameterized using data from the Ashanti region, Ghana. The model distinguishes between two hunting techniques, snaring and gun hunting. We analyse the impact of key economic parameters on off–takes. Economic incentives determine the effort devoted to hunting, the choice of hunting technique, and the species that are consumed domestically or traded in markets. These factors, together with the growth rates and catchabilities of hunted species, determine the ecological impact of hunting. The results suggest that increased bushmeat prices are likely to lead to a switch from snaring, which is cheaper but less efficient, to gun hunting, with a consequent impact on vulnerable species. Increases in agricultural prices have an ambiguous effect on hunter behaviour, depending on the balance between incentives to invest in agriculture and increased consumption as incomes improve. Penalties are more effective if they target bushmeat sales, rather than the act of hunting. This model represents a step forward because it explicitly considers bushmeat as a component of the household economy. This has important implications as regards the development of policies to conserve species hunted for bushmeat.},

The method is a decision framework for determining what forest areas should be managed as habitat to meet a population viability constraint and what areas should be used for timber production to maximize the present value of revenue from timber yields. The viability constraint is a minimum probability of meeting a standard for the risk of population extinction. This viability constraint focuses regulatory decisions on two key parameters: the standard for extinction risk and the probability of attaining the standard. The decision model is used to estimate the economic costs of these parameters. Examples for single- and multi-patch conservation problems show that the cost of habitat preservation increases as the standard for extinction risk becomes more stringent and as the required probability of attainment increases. Results from the decision model are useful for evaluating research and monitoring activities and determining the economically efficient risk standard.},

A simplified wildlife model was developed from the fully parameterized spatial wildlife model, using a habitat neighborhood-weighting scheme, for use in the optimization. Simulated annealing, a heuristic optimization technique, was used to solve for harvest schedules that maximized the net present value of timber harvest subject to a target value for likelihood of species persistence over a 100-year planning period. By solving this problem for a range of species persistence targets, a production possibility frontier was developed that showed tradeoffs between timber harvest value and likelihood of species persistence on this landscape. Although the results are specific to the wildlife species and the landscape analyzed, the approach is general and provides a structure for future models that will help land managers and forest planners to understand tradeoffs among competing resource uses.},

This study developed quantitative models to improve the management of these mixed forests of fir, spruce, and beech. A nonlinear matrix model of stand growth was estimated and validated with medium-term projections and simulations of long-term stand dynamics. The ecological criteria were Shannon's index of tree diversity by species and size, the minimum number of trees in any species-size class, and basal area. The economic criteria were the present value of harvests, gross or net of the value of the growing stock, and the rate of return on the capital invested in the growing stock. Linear and goal programming were used to determine the effects, on all criteria, of managements that would maintain the stand in a steady state, and either (i) remove only the dead trees, (ii) maintain the forest close to its current state, (iii) achieve economic efficiency, subject to a desired level of diversity, (iv) maximize diversity, with or without constraints on economic returns. The results suggested that a light management could improve tree diversity, relative to natural stand growth. Maximum economic efficiency would require a substantial reduction in basal area and average size of trees, and it would lead to low tree diversity. Maximizing unconstrained tree diversity would be costly. Managements that conciliated diversity and economic efficiency all required a decrease in the basal area of stands, relative to their current state. A simple approach to convert a stand from its current condition to a desired steady state was investigated},

   abstract = {Markov decision process (MDP) models were effective in analyzing forest management policies. Even the simplest standard results gave useful insights into forest ecology, such as how landscape diversity is shaped by natural catastrophes, and how forests mature through successional phases. The methods were also useful to predict the effects of different management policies on ecological and economic criteria. Optimization augmented the usefulness of the approach, suggesting that income from Wisconsin's maple-birch forests could be increased without ruining their diversity of landscape, tree size, and tree species. It showed that maximizing species diversity, defined by the distribution of trees in shade-tolerance classes, would require some harvest. Instead, maximum tree size diversity occurred in unmanaged forests, but this gave a less diverse landscape and no income. The MDP method allowed for the design of compromise policies that would maximize income while keeping diversity above specified limits. The opportunity cost of increasing tree size diversity was found to be much higher than for species diversity. Comparing the maximum timber income owners could have got with what they actually cut suggested that the amenity value of forests was four times that of timber. Advantages of the methods reside in the ability to model complex ecosystem processes with simple probability matrices, and in the rich MDP theory and algorithms. Limitations include the difficulty of defining a space set large enough for accurate discretization, but small enough for practical application.},

Results from an empirical application of the model confirm that the current mix of policies to control bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand is achieving lower levels of prevalence than would prevail in the absence of a national strategy. These policies do, however, appear to remove some of the individual incentive to control disease.},

   abstract = {We investigate wildlife disease management, in a bioeconomic framework, when the wildlife host is valuable and disease transmission is density-dependent. Disease prevalence is reduced in density-dependent models whenever the population is harvested below a host-density threshold a threshold population density below which disease prevalence declines and above which a disease becomes epidemic. In conventional models, the threshold is an exogenous function of disease parameters. We consider this case and find a steady state with positive disease prevalence to be optimal. Next, we consider a case in which disease dynamics are affected by both population controls and changes in human-environmental interactions. The host-density threshold is endogenous in this case. That is, the manager does not simply manage the population relative to the threshold, but rather manages both the population and the threshold. The optimal threshold depends on the economic and ecological trade-offs arising from the jointly-determined system. Accounting for this endogene-ity can lead to reduced disease prevalence rates and higher population levels. Additionally, we show that ecological parameters that may be unimportant in conventional models that do not account for the endogeneity of the host-density threshold are potentially important when host density threshold is recognized as endogenous.},

The rate of range expansion can be reduced by eradication of isolated gypsy moth infestations in a barrier zone that is located just beyond the expanding population front and is slowly shifted in the direction of population spread. We developed a model to optimize the allocation of resources for monitoring and treatment of isolated colonies in a barrier zone. Model parameters were estimated using data collected in the central Appalachian Mountains. The model predicted that the cost of slowing population spread is minimized when the density of pheromone traps and eradication activity within the barrier zone decrease with increasing distance from the population front. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the output was most sensitive to the change of the maximum distance from the population front at which colonies can become established. The present value of predicted costs of all monitoring and treatment in the barrier zone were <1/4 the present value of expected benefits from slowing the spread of the gypsy moth over 25 yr.},

This paper develops an ecological-economic argument for the effective management of plant invasions in mountain fynbos ecosystems. We do this by building a dynamic ecological economic model which values the ecosystem services that fynbos ecosystems provide under different management regimes. We propose that the services that mountain fynbos ecosystems provide fall into six components: water production, wildflower harvest, hiker visitation, ecotourist visitation, endemic species and genetic storage. A scenario analysis based on a hypothetical 4 km2 mountain fynbos ecosystem in the western part of the fynbos biome estimated that the ecosystem's value varies from R19 million (under low valuation and poor management scenario) to R300 million (under high valuation and good management scenario) [R4.50 = US\$1]. Water production and genetic storage were the most valuable ecosystem services. The model showed that the cost of clearing alien plants (under the proactive management scenario) was a tiny (0.6-5\%) proportion of the value of mountain fynbos ecosystems. This result motivates an injection of funds for clearing alien plants from mountain fynbos ecosystems.},

In light of the potential increased trade with Cuba, the potential arrival of invasive species such as bark beetles and ambrosia beetles—particularly from Asia via Cuban imports—could represent a serious threat for the southern U.S. forestlands. We develop a bioeconomic model that estimates potential economic damages to southern pine forests caused by the hypothetical introduction of an unknown Asian bark or ambrosia beetle via future trade with Cuba for the study period 2018–2050. We examine individual policies and combinations of them that could be considered in response to this hypothetical situation. Using the pre-revolution Cuban level of imports, the economic damages in absence of “any policy or management action” could reach \$2.44 million (\$76,250/year). These damages could be reduced to between \$469,000 (\$14,656/year) and \$1.02 million (\$31,875/year) if a risk mitigation policy (forest thinning) were implemented. When prevention polices are considered as the baseline, the risk mitigation policy (combined with prevention) is again observed to be the dominant policy. The differences between the various combinations with respect to the prevention policy are relatively minor ranging between \$856,000 (\$26,750/year) and \$1.30 million (\$40,635/year). These findings should be interpreted with caution given the limited amount of empirical data and policy assumptions, but they nonetheless can inform policy choices related to trade, pests, and Cuba.},

A species may provide utility directly to humans, or it may provide utility indirectly because it is used either as a raw material in goods fabrication or as sustenance for other species. We describe a comparative static equilibrium of the ecosystem where species' demands for other species are equal to the supplies of those other species, and energy is conserved. The ecosystem is then embedded in the economy so that the effects of human intervention can be traced through both the ecosystem and the economy. Human intervention creates ecosystem externalities such that ecosystem equilibria are shifted and the new equilibria affect the utility or the production processes of other humans. This framework allows us to describe in principle which ecosystem services can be efficiently usurped by humans, which waste flows can be efficiently allowed into ecosystems, and which ecosystem organisms and physical attributes can be efficiently maintained.},

The economic feasibility of seed kill for controlling wild oats in wheat is evaluated using a dynamic programming model linked to a bioeconomic simulation model. In the context of Australian wheat crops, the tactic of killing wild oat seeds was found to be economically viable under some conditions when combined with existing weed management practices. From this, it is suggested that it would be prudent to divert some research funds into developing this tactic. The two critical parameters which determine the viability of the seed kill option are the effectiveness of the control agent in killing seeds and the cost of the treatment. Assuming 60\% seed kill as the upper limit, seed kill is economically feasible only if it costs less than (Australian) \$12/ha per year. When seed kill is economically feasible, the profits increase due to initial yield advantages caused by rapid depletion in seed reserves as well as by overall savings in herbicide cost. The analysis indicated that the savings in herbicide usage could be as high as 65\%. Indirect benefits from such drastic reduction in herbicide usage, although not evaluated in this study, could also be realised.},

   abstract = {Summary. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the economic benefits associated with an integrated weed management approach for wild oats (Avena fatua and A. ludoviciana) in northern New South Wales involving chemical and non-chemical controls. The paper presents a framework for assessing the population dynamics of wild oats and the economics of a range of control options over 15 years. Wild oats is a weed primarily of winter crops which, as a consequence of its persistence and its impact upon yields, leads to significant economic losses in the grain growing regions of Australia. In this study, a dynamic programming model is developed to examine the impact of a range of management strategies for the control of wild oats in wheat. The strategies evaluated include conventional herbicide control to reduce weed densities, the use of selective herbicides to reduce seed set of the weed, and summer crop and winter fallow rotational options which provide a break in the cereal cycle and allow accelerated control of wild oat populations. The hypothesis for the study, that strategies which involve measures that directly reduce seed production and minimise wild oats seed bank populations will yield the greatest economic benefit, is acceptable based on the findings of the study. The work also shows that a dynamic programming model provides a means of determining the optimal combination of strategies over time for various initial values of the seed bank. The methodology is considered to have general application as a framework for evaluating the economics of weed control problems in annual cropping systems.},

The particular policy examined is that of switching from a traditional system, where commercial ranchers do not harvest wildlife herbivores, to one where ranchers are provided economic incentives to adopt multiple-use management of the range resource. Simulations using an adaptive controller indicate that the effects of the polity change on wildlife populations depend on the conditions of the ecosystem and, importantly, on ranchers' attitudes to risk. When forage is abundant, and game and livestock do not compete for food, the policy change leads to reduced wildlife populations, especially of the relatively more valuable species. This indicates that game cropping may not he more compatible with nature conservation than standard pastoralist practices. However, in periods of drought when competition for forage occurs, the policy change may dampen the decline in game populations, as risk-averse ranchers may decide to sell more cattle and harvest wildlife instead. Game cropping reduces wildlife populations, but increases their stability.},

   abstract = {Using bio-economic modelling, this paper analyses conflicts between legal and illegal activities in the Campo-Ma'an National Park, Cameroon. We consider two different agents, a local community living near the Park - who hunt illegally to fulfil their welfare -, and a park manager who has received from the Cameroonian government the mandate to manage the wildlife found in the park. The park manager is assumed to practice an imperfect anti-poaching policy due to the persistence of poaching activities in the study area. Both agents are assumed to proceed in strategic and asymmetric interdependency where the park manager determines the anti-poaching effort and then the local people have to adjust their behaviour within a full park scheme. In a bid to reduce illegal hunting, the social planner - the Cameroonian government - then tries to implement another scheme in which the local people are allowed to hunt in the surrounding area of the park, through the establishment of community hunting zones. This park-plus-hunting scheme is an example of Integrated and Conservation Development Project. The empirical analysis is based on data drawn from different sources. Results show that the anti-poaching efforts, the wildlife stock and the harvesting rate are lesser when some hunting rights are allowed to local people as compared to what they are under full park regime. However, by recognizing some hunting rights to the local people, the share of income lost by the park is almost recovered and all poachers leave the underground to exercise in legality as hunters.},

   abstract = {We present a dynamic optimization model for harvesting timber and moose when the moose inflicts costs by browsing young trees. To illustrate its behaviour, the model was run numerically for Norwegian market conditions. Optimal management in our model kept moose at an approximately 70\% lower density than if managed without concern for timber production. Further, the harvest of moose was slightly reduced around the time of timbering to take advantage of increased forage production in coming years. Thereby a fluctuating pattern in moose harvest was generated over time. The amplitude of these fluctuations depended on the productivity of the site, while the period of the fluctuations depended on the fixed costs of harvesting timber. On a particular land, the optimal harvesting strategy for timber was determined by (i) the relationship between timber prices and fixed costs of harvesting, (ii) the relationship between prices of timber and moose, and (iii) the length of the planning period in relation to initial standing biomass of trees. Within a wide range of the present market regime, combined production of both timber and moose was the most profitable strategy. Still, for all our planning scenarios more than 90\% of the income came from timber. To give this and similar models accurate applied value, more field data are needed to adequately quantify the interactions between moose and forest vegetation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Bio-invasions occur in management mosaics where local control affects spread and damage across political boundaries. We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The increasing economic and environmental losses caused by non-native invasive species amplify the value of identifying and implementing optimal management options to prevent, detect, and control invasive species. Previous literature has focused largely on preventing introductions of invasive species and post-detection control activities; few have addressed the role of detection. By increasing resources to detect invasive species, managers may increase their chances of finding a species at a smaller population level, lessening the extent of damages and making subsequent control potentially less expensive and more effective. However, detecting new invasive species is difficult and uncertain; many factors reduce the likelihood of successful detection, such as low population densities which are prevalent in invasive species management. This paper presents a model that captures the stochastic and dynamic aspects of this trade-off by incorporating a detection stage in which the agency managers choose search effort prior to the post-detection control stage. The analysis of the model illustrates that the optimal detection strategy depends primarily on the 'detectability', or ease of detection, and the biological relationships of each distinct species.},

This management problem is formulated as a linear programming problem and solved for the fourteen different species in the CHA. The LP problem is formulated in such a way as to utilise the same data that is the basis for present management decision-making. The objective function takes into account that animals are hunted for both meat and trophies. Only a fraction of each population is suitable for trophy hunting and higher prices are usual for such animals. The model considers fourteen species divided according to their food preferences into four groups. There is a carrying capacity constraint which limits the weighted sum of the populations in each of these groups. Further constraints relate to the specific growth rates of each species. The optimal equilibrium population levels were calculated to serve as goals or targets. However, droughts and other natural phenomena which affect population numbers are frequently encountered at Mkuze. A number of experiments were therefore performed where the populations were set to reduced levels. The optimal control problem which steers the populations towards the target levels in an optimal way was formulated. Some illustrative solutions are presented.},

This paper reviews three cost-minimizing wildlife-control models, each internalizing the diffusion externality under different management scenarios, namely, unilateral management, bilateral management, and centralized management. The three management scenarios lead to different optimal behaviors. Property owners exerting unilateral control must leave some wildlife untrapped to generate sufficient population pressure against the flow of continual immigration from neighboring populations. Analysis of the bilateral model indicates that noncooperating neighboring landowners having varying pay-off functions will end up with leaving all wildlife untrapped in their parcels. Under the centralized management scenario, landowners find it most profitable to collectively delegate the control responsibility of an entire watershed to a single manager.},

We present a model to analyze costs and benefits of altering the spread rates of invading organisms. The target rate of population expansion (which may be positive or negative) is considered as a control function, and the present value of net benefits from managing population spread is the criterion that is maximized. Two local maxima of the present value of net benefits are possible: one for eradication and another for slowing the spread. If both maxima are present, their heights are compared, and the strategy that corresponds to a higher value is selected. The optimal strategy changes from eradication to slowing the spread to finally doing nothing, as the area occupied by the species increases, the negative impact of the pest per unit area decreases, or the discount rate increases. The model shows that slowing population spread is a viable strategy of pest control even when a relatively small area remains uninfested. Stopping population spread is not an optimal strategy unless natural barriers to population spread exist. The model is applied to managing the spread of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations in the United States.},

The calves, yearlings, and females are hunted for meat, while the males are hunted for trophies and where the demand for trophy hunting depends on price and quality. We find that trophy hunting boosts the male population and yields a high ratio of males to females. The main reason for this result is that we consider a management scheme with well defined property rights and not of the 'open-access' type, and where the key mechanism is the quality demand effect in trophy hunting. In an extended model where ecological theory of animal adoption to hunting is assumed to influence the biology through fertility we still find that trophy hunting boosts the male stock.},

First, there is an agency managing the wildlife and the habitat of the wildlife, which is referred to as parkland. On the other hand, there is the group of agro-pastoralists living in the vicinity of the wildlife habitat, whose land-use is referred to as rangelands. The parkland is used for tourism production and hunting, while the rangelands are used for agro-pastoral production. Both agents will find it beneficial to expand their land-use, so there is a land-use conflict. This is analysed in two steps. First, social optimality is studied; then we study the utilization of the wildlife and its accompanying land-use when there is no unified resource policy and the park agency follows its self-interest. The effects on the two different management schemes of changing economic conditions, such as the recommendations of the CITES convention and a programme subsidizing agro-pastoral production, are discussed.},

   abstract = {The bioeconomic analysis of endangered species without consumptive values can be problematic when analysed with density-dependent models that assume a fixed environment size. Most bioeconomic models use harvest as a control variable, yet when modelling non-harvestable species, frequently the only variable under control of conservation ists is the quantity of habitat to be made available. The authors explore the implications of this in a model developed to analyse the potential population recovery of New Zealand's yellow-eyed penguin. The penguin faces severe competition with man for the terrestrial resources required for breeding and has declined in population to perilously low levels. The model was developed to estimate the land use required for recovery and preservation of the species and to compare the results to current tourism-driven conservation efforts. It is demonstrated that land may serve as a useful control variable in bioeconomic models and that such a model may be useful for determining whether sufficient incentives exist to preserve a species. However, the model may generate less useful results for providing a specific estimate of the optimal allocation of land to such a species. .},

Still, the social value of biodiversity is not adequately incorporated into forest management and decision support models. This study proposes a novel approach for defining socially optimal biodiversity levels, wood supply and taxation schemes under climate change. We developed a partial equilibrium model to maximize consumers’ and producers’ surplus until the end of the century, including climate change impacts as productivity shocks in a coupled ecological-economic framework. In our model, we consider a first-best and a second-best taxation scheme to internalize the value of forest biodiversity into forest planning. The framework developed here was applied to a temperate forest landscape in southwestern Germany, where biodiversity has a high social value. Our results indicate an increasing consumption of wood and supply of biodiversity (up to 38.4 \%) until the end of the century. Moreover, climate change may affect forest productivity, optimal harvesting rates and taxation schemes. Crucially, current management is unable to capture the adequate social value of biodiversity and is inefficient under climate change. Policy mechanisms are therefore required to correct biodiversity provision in temperate forest landscapes.},

As a case study, the model was calibrated with economic, agronomic and ecological data from the Torrecchia Vecchia agroecosystem in Italy. In our analysis of optimal land use allocation, the results showed that diversified land use is required to provide a good balance between provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services. More specifically, the development of woodlands alongside farming activities had a positive impact on the soil quality score and on landscape heterogeneity, which is a proxy for ecosystem function and resilience. These findings demonstrate that the inclusion of woodlands can alleviate the trade-offs between provisioning and non-provisioning services as they can generate profit while allowing for better soil quality and biodiversity relative to more intensive land use. The study also confirms that a landscape-scale method can be used to investigate agroecosystem management problems when spatially explicit data is not available.},

This can lead to problems of path-dependence and lock-in effects. Path dependence describes situations where history strongly influences present decisions and lock-in effects refer to situations where an earlier decision provides strong incentives to follow a particular path, even if more efficient alternatives are available later on. We develop a conceptual ecological-economic model to investigate which ecological and economic parameters favour the appearance of efficiency losses in biodiversity conservation due to path dependence and lock-in effects in a dynamic two-period two-region model. Generally we find that efficiency losses occur if there are signals that guide the first-period budget into a region that later turns out to be suboptimal if both time periods had been considered right from the beginning. To illustrate the conservation relevance of our findings, we present potential efficiency losses through path dependence in the hypothetical case of applying offsets to conserving the endangered Maculinea teleius butterfly near the city of Landau in Germany.},

   abstract = {One target of biological conservation is the protection of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, in their land-use decisions, farmers are often challenged with balancing biodiversity maintenance and profit generation. Under the current agricultural system, this tends to result in intensive farming which destroys suitable habitat for wild species. Thus, the potential for land-use conflicts between agriculture and biological conservation is high. Previous studies that investigated the effects of subsidies and taxes suggest mild trade-offs between conservation and farming, thus favouring land-sharing solutions to biological conservation. However, many ecological-economic models that dealt with this issue neglect possible Allee effects, which have been found by ecologists to be a common phenomenon. The existence of Allee effects markedly alters predictions of ecological-economic models: we show that conservation success is accompanied by substantial losses in agricultural production. More suitable habitat is required to prevent extinction of the species of interest, and conservation measures should start before the population has declined to some critical value. We emphasize the effect of spatial fragmentation on population viability under an Allee effect, as a clumped area of suitable habitat protects a population much better from extinction than a fragmented mosaic of habitat patches.},

Agricultural and forestry activities are one major anthropogenic driver of this decline. The underlying land-use changes result in the alteration of species habitats. In this context reconciling economic and ecological objectives of agricultural policies remains an ongoing challenge. In that respect, this paper presents the bioeconomic impacts of contrasted agricultural public policy scenarios. We developped a bio-economic model coupling an ecological model of bird dynamics with a micro-economic model of land management estimated with French data. We assessed the performances of the scenarios based on 5 ecological indicators accounting for various structural and functionnal characteristics while economic performances refer to land-use incomes. First our study confirms the potential long-term synergies between several ecological and economic objectives in grassland-based policies. Second we points out the non-trivial effect of agroforestry policies on agricultural biodiversity: despite a positive overall impact on the biodiversity population size, it implies important structural changes within the community. The choice between grassland-based policies such as in Agri-Environmental Schemes and agroforestry policies will thus depend on the ecological stakeholders’ preferences.},

We developed and utilized multi-objective numeric optimization models to analyze the trade-offs between biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES). The approach was used in the land-use planning process in northern Finland when selecting potential peat production sites as a part of the development of the regional master plan. We first quantified Net Present Value (NPV) of peat production, biodiversity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water emissions of peatlands. Then we applied multi-objective optimization to examine the trade-offs between the variables as well as to determine a cost-efficient selection of potential peat production sites, that is, a selection which would simultaneously generate the greatest possible economic returns and environmental benefits. Our results showed that with a relatively small decrease in NPV, a substantial decrease in biodiversity loss and a reduction in water emissions compared to the benchmark level could be attained. However, a significant decrease in GHG emissions resulted in a substantial decrease in NPV. We conclude that it is possible to significantly improve land-use management by applying multi-objective optimization in land-use planning.},

Previous studies have analysed the effectiveness of market-based instruments on single or multiple but independent species. On the example of tradable land-use permits we address an important issue for the first time: the conservation of interacting species (metacommunities). We consider two competing species where the superior competitor locally replaces the inferior competitor. Both species are structured as metapopulations, i.e. can go locally extinct while empty habitats can be recolonised by local populations on neighbouring habitats. Combining a spatially explicit and dynamic ecological-economic simulation model with cluster analysis we investigate how the coexistence of both species depends on the design of the tradable permit scheme, and how the effective scheme design (i.e. the scheme design that maximises coexistence) depends on the biological characteristics of the two species. We show that scheme designs that are effective for the conservation of single species may be ineffective for the conservation of two competing species and that the effectiveness of a scheme with regard to coexistence strongly depends on the relative performances of the two species with regard to their colonisation abilities and local extinction risks.},

A key question in the design of such payment schemes is for how long the land owners shall commit themselves to carry out biodiversity-enhancing land use measures, i.e. the length of contracts. From an ecological perspective, longer contracts seem better as they ensure that an area stays a suitable habitat for a longer time. However, with longer contracts land owners are likely to demand a higher annual compensation payment if they give up for a longer time their right to manage their land in a way they prefer. We analyse with a conceptual ecological-economic model how the cost-effectiveness of short versus long contract lengths depends on different ecological and economic parameters. We demonstrate the practical relevance of the model by applying it to the case of butterfly conservation in a region in Germany. Our results suggest that for the case study a 5-year contract is more cost-effective than a 10-year contract. Overall, we find that when deciding about the contract length economic parameters (for example the budget size where high budgets favour long contract lengths) and ecological parameters (for example species colonisation rates where high rates favour short contract lengths) need to be considered.},

   abstract = {Payments to compensate landowners for carrying out costly land-use measures that benefit endangered biodiversity have become an important policy instrument. When designing such payments, it is important to take into account that spatially connected habitats are more valuable for many species than isolated ones. One way to incentivize provision of connected habitats is to offer landowners an agglomeration bonus, that is, a bonus on top of payments they are receiving to conserve land if the land is spatially connected. Researchers have compared the cost-effectiveness of the agglomeration bonus with 2 alternatives: an all-or-nothing, agglomeration payment, where landowners receive a payment only if the conserved land parcels have a certain level of spatial connectivity, and a spatially homogeneous payment, where landowners receive a payment for conserved land parcels irrespective of their location. Their results show the agglomeration bonus is rarely the most cost-effective option, and when it is, it is only slightly better than one of the alternatives. This suggests that the agglomeration bonus should not be given priority as a policy design option. However, this finding is based on consideration of only 1 species. We examined whether the same applied to 2 species, one for which the homogeneous payment is best and the other for which the agglomeration payment is most cost-effective. We modified a published conceptual model so that we were able to assess the cost-effectiveness of payment schemes for 2 species and applied it to a grassland bird and a grassland butterfly in Germany that require the same habitat but have different spatial-connectivity needs. When conserving both species, the agglomeration bonus was more cost-effective than the agglomeration and the homogeneous payment; thus, we showed that as a policy the agglomeration bonus is a useful conservation-payment option.},

The procedure's main novelty is that it considers variations of the costs and impacts on species and grassland types that arise from different timings of the land use measures.

The objective of this paper is to consider economic, social and ecological objectives within the design of agricultural public policies. Using a bio-economic model applied to France, we compare different optimal public strategies. We show that, when the biodiversity objectives are either very limited or very demanding, grassland subsidies are the best instruments from both green and sustainable points of view. However for medium objectives, reducing crops subsidies is the cheapest way to green the CAP, while subsidies on grasslands are the only strategy from a sustainability perspective. Our work highlights new trade-offs related to policy implementation, such as social acceptance or technical difficulties, and the spatial equity of performance among regions.},

   abstract = {Conservation outcomes are uncertain. Agencies making decisions about what threat mitigation actions to take to save which species frequently face the dilemma of whether to invest in actions with high probability of success and guaranteed benefits or to choose projects with a greater risk of failure that might provide higher benefits if they succeed. The answer to this dilemma lies in the decision maker's aversion to risk-their unwillingness to accept uncertain outcomes. Little guidance exists on how risk preferences affect conservation investment priorities. Using a prioritization approach based on cost effectiveness, we compared 2 approaches: a conservative probability threshold approach that excludes investment in projects with a risk of management failure greater than a fixed level, and a variance-discounting heuristic used in economics that explicitly accounts for risk tolerance and the probabilities of management success and failure. We applied both approaches to prioritizing projects for 700 of New Zealand's threatened species across 8303 management actions. Both decision makers' risk tolerance and our choice of approach to dealing with risk preferences drove the prioritization solution (i.e., the species selected for management). Use of a probability threshold minimized uncertainty, but more expensive projects were selected than with variance discounting, which maximized expected benefits by selecting the management of species with higher extinction risk and higher conservation value. Explicitly incorporating risk preferences within the decision making process reduced the number of species expected to be safe from extinction because lower risk tolerance resulted in more species being excluded from management, but the approach allowed decision makers to choose a level of acceptable risk that fit with their ability to accommodate failure. We argue for transparency in risk tolerance and recommend that decision makers accept risk in an adaptive management framework to maximize benefits and avoid potential extinctions due to inefficient allocation of limited resources.},

One of the most pressing issues facing the global conservation community is how to distribute limited resources between regions identified as priorities for biodiversity conservation1,2,3. Approaches such as biodiversity hotspots4, endemic bird areas5 and ecoregions6 are used by international organizations to prioritize conservation efforts globally7. Although identifying priority regions is an important first step in solving this problem, it does not indicate how limited resources should be allocated between regions. Here we formulate how to allocate optimally conservation resources between regions identified as priorities for conservation—the ‘conservation resource allocation problem’. Stochastic dynamic programming is used to find the optimal schedule of resource allocation for small problems but is intractable for large problems owing to the “curse of dimensionality”8. We identify two easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret heuristics that closely approximate the optimal solution. We also show the importance of both correctly formulating the problem and using information on how investment returns change through time. Our conservation resource allocation approach can be applied at any spatial scale. We demonstrate the approach with an example of optimal resource allocation among five priority regions in Wallacea and Sundaland, the transition zone between Asia and Australasia.},

   abstract = {Substantial declines in farmland biodiversity have been reported in Europe for several decades. Agricultural changes have been identified as a main driver of these declines. Although different agrienvironmental schemes have been implemented, their positive effect on biodiversity is relatively unknown. This raises the question as to how to reconcile farming production and biodiversity conservation to operationalize a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. We devised a bioeconomic model and conducted an analysis based on coviability of farmland biodiversity and agriculture. The coviability approach extended population viability analyses by including bioeconomic risk. Our model coupled stochastic dynamics of both biodiversity and farming land-uses selected at the microlevel with public policies at the macrolevel on the basis of financial incentives (taxes or subsidies) for land uses. The coviability approach made it possible for us to evaluate bioeconomic risks of these public incentives through the probability of satisfying a mix of biodiversity and economic constraints over time. We calibrated the model and applied it to a community of 34 common birds in metropolitan France at the small agricultural regions scale. We identified different public policies and scenarios with tolerable (0-0\%) agroecological risk and modeled their outcomes up to 2050. Budgetary, economic, and ecological (based on Farmland Bird Index) constraints were essential to understanding the set of viable public policies. Our results suggest that some combinations of taxes on cereals and subsidies on grasslands could be relevant to develop a multifunctional agriculture. Moreover, the flexibility and multicriteria viewpoint underlying the coviability approach may help in the implementation of adaptive management.},

   abstract = {Significant decline of biodiversity in farmlands has been reported for several decades. To limit the negative impact of agriculture, many agro-environmental schemes have been implemented, but their effectiveness remains controversial. In this context, the study of economic drivers is helpful to understand the role played by farming on biodiversity. The present paper analyzes the impact of risk aversion on farmland biodiversity. Here "risk aversion" means a cautious behavior of farmers facing uncertainty. We develop a bioeconomic model that articulates bird community dynamics and representative farmers selecting land uses within an uncertain macro-economic context. It is specialized and calibrated at a regional scale for France through national databases. The influence of risk aversion is assessed on ecological, agricultural, and economic outputs through projections at the 2050 horizon. A high enough risk aversion appears sufficient to both manage economic risk and promote ecological performance. This occurs through a diversification mechanism on regional land uses. However, economic calibration leads to a weak risk-aversion parameter, which is consistent with the current decline of farmland birds. Spatial disparities however suggest that public incentives could be necessary to reinforce the diversification and bioeconomic effectiveness.},

   abstract = {Production of marketed commodities and protection of biodiversity in natural systems often conflict and thus the continuously expanding human needs for more goods and benefits from global ecosystems urgently calls for strategies to resolve this conflict. In this paper, we addressed what is the potential of a forest landscape to simultaneously produce habitats for species and economic returns, and how the conflict between habitat availability and timber production varies among taxa. Secondly, we aimed at revealing an optimal combination of management regimes that maximizes habitat availability for given levels of economic returns. We used multi-objective optimization tools to analyze data from a boreal forest landscape consisting of about 30,000 forest stands simulated 50 years into future. We included seven alternative management regimes, spanning from the recommended intensive forest management regime to complete set-aside of stands (protection), and ten different taxa representing a wide variety of habitat associations and social values. Our results demonstrate it is possible to achieve large improvements in habitat availability with little loss in economic returns. In general, providing dead-wood associated species with more habitats tended to be more expensive than providing requirements for other species. No management regime alone maximized habitat availability for the species, and systematic use of any single management regime resulted in considerable reductions in economic returns. Compared with an optimal combination of management regimes, a consistent application of the recommended management regime would result in 5\% reduction in economic returns and up to 270\% reduction in habitat availability. Thus, for all taxa a combination of management regimes was required to achieve the optimum. Refraining from silvicultural thinnings on a proportion of stands should be considered as a cost-effective management in commercial forests to reconcile the conflict between economic returns and habitat required by species associated with dead-wood. In general, a viable strategy to maintain biodiversity in production landscapes would be to diversify management regimes. Our results emphasize the importance of careful landscape level forest management planning because optimal combinations of management regimes were taxon-specific. For cost-efficiency, the results call for balanced and correctly targeted strategies among habitat types.},

Artificial waterpoints are constructed by wildlife managers to supplement natural water supplies, to support herbivore populations. The aim of this paper is to analyse how a landowner may realize his ecological and economic goals by manipulating waterpoints for the management of an elephant population, a water-dependent species in the presence of water-independent species. We develop a theoretical bio-economic framework to analyse the optimization of wildlife management objectives (in this case revenue generation from both consumptive and non-consumptive use and biodiversity conservation), using waterpoint construction as a control variable. The model provides a bio-economic framework for analysing optimization problems where a control has direct effects on one herbivore species but indirect effects on the other. A landowner may be interested only in maximization of profits either from elephant offtake and/or tourism revenue, ignoring the negative effects that could be brought about by elephants to biodiversity. If the landowner does not take the indirect effects of waterpoints into consideration, then the game reserve management, as the authority entrusted with the sustainable management of the game reserve, might use economic instruments such as subsidies or taxes to the landowners to enforce sound waterpoint management.},

Common policy simplifications result in a 49-100\% loss in biodiversity benefits depending on the conservation target chosen.

As with other low intensity farming systems across Europe, crofting is changing in response to a range of socio-economic factors. This is having a negative impact on the populations of rare bumblebees that are associated with this agricultural system. In this paper we use an ecological-economic modelling approach to examine the likely impacts of introducing two different management options for conserving bumblebees on croft land-use and income. Two linear programming models were constructed to represent the predominant crofting systems found in the Outer Hebrides, and varying constraints on bumblebee abundance were imposed to examine the trade-off between conservation and agricultural incomes. The model outputs illustrate that in some instances it is likely that both agricultural profits and bumblebee densities can be enhanced. We conclude that policy-makers should take into consideration the type of farming system when designing cost-effective agri-environment policies for low intensity farming systems, and that improvements in bee conservation are not necessarily in conflict with maintaining farm income.},

   abstract = {Conserving nature in the presence of humans is especially challenging in areas where livelihoods are largely based on locally available natural resources. The restoration of forests in such contexts calls for the identification of sites and actions that improve biodiversity protection, and ensure the provision of and accessibility to other forest-related ecosystem services. This paper introduces an integer-linear programming (ILP) approach to identify reforestation priorities that achieve such goals. Applications of ILP to nature conservation are many, but only a few of them deal with the problem of restoration, and none of the available models considers the basic needs of the local population. Given constraints on a restoration budget, the potential conversion of productive lands and the travel time to reach harvestable forest, the model maximises the amount of reforestation area (weighted by priority values) and minimises the harvesting of existing forest, while ensuring the conservation of landscape diversity, the satisfaction of timber demands and the stabilisation of erosion-prone land. As an input, suitability maps, generated through a combination of ecological criteria, are used to prioritise the selection of reforestation sites. An application to a 430km 2 area in Central Chiapas (Mexico) resulted in compact patches and thus a manageable reforestation plan. Acceptable trade-offs were found between the amount of soil stabilisation possible and the prioritisation goals, while uncertainty in the prioritisation scores did not significantly affect the results. We show that restoration actions can be spatially designed to benefit both nature and people with minimal losses on both sides.},

Land that is converted may or may not be lost as habitat for many species. In some cases, monoculture production for example, land conversion reduces the number niches and hence the level of biodiversity. In other cases, it has the opposite effect. We address the problem of anthropogenic biodiversity change due to the effects of both harvest rates and land use decisions on landscape heterogeneity. If the optimal structure of the landscape is extremely homogeneous, forces of competitive exclusion will lead to a single surviving species. If it is extremely heterogeneous, multiple species will coexist, with each species exclusively dominating the patch type to which it is best suited. Where changes in biodiversity due to changes in landscape heterogeneity are not taken into account in land use decisions, they are external effects of those decisions. We identify measures of these effects.},

We focus on the ecological interactions rather than on administrative restrictions. Our findings are based both, on theoretical considerations and field investigations of ecological and economic parameters in Azerbaijan and Iran. The results of the numerical optimization suggest that it is optimal to separate timber and livestock production if biodiversity is not valued. Livestock rearing is preferable at high discount rates whereas timber production becomes more profitable at low discount rates. If the valuation of diversity exceeds a certain threshold a combination of timber production and livestock rearing is socially optimal since it yields a high biological diversity.},

Because funding for biological conservation is limited, it is important to distinguish the most efficient ways to use it. Here, we assess implications of alternative measures to conserve biodiversity in managed boreal forest landscapes. We calculated four alternative spatio-temporal scenarios and compared these to the current management regime over 100-year time period. In the alternative scenarios, a fixed amount of funding was invested in (1) permanent large reserves (each tens of ha in size), (2) permanent small reserves (each a few ha in size), (3) temporary small reserves (based on 10-year contracts with private land owners), and (4) green-tree retention (small groups of trees retained on clear-cuts). To assess biodiversity implications, we used habitat suitability indices to calculate overall habitat availability for five groups of red-listed and habitat-specific species associated with decaying spruce logs. The possibilities for timber harvests did not differ among the scenarios, but biodiversity performance was different. The scenarios with permanent reserves tended to outperform other scenarios, suggesting that conservation policies based on permanent reserves are the most cost-efficient in the long term. Results, however, varied among time scales and species groups. In the short term, a strategy of investment in temporary small reserves was the most efficient. Habitat for species associated with old spruce dead-wood and preferring shade was rare throughout all simulations, and therefore, it is likely that these species cannot be sustained in managed forests. Species that live on fresh dead-wood and are associated with forest edges coped well in all scenarios suggesting that such species will persist in managed landscapes without additional conservation efforts. Explicit definition of conservation objectives and time frames for conservation action are thus prerequisites for successful conservation planning.},

   abstract = {Exurban areas have increasingly become zones of conflict as conservation and development compete for the same finite land resources. Conversion of natural areas to land dominated by human use results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment or even extinction. Recently, reserve site selection models have begun to integrate spatial attributes in order to design more compact and connected reserve networks that are thought to improve long-term species persistence. While these models are a good step forward to designing conservation reserve networks, they might not be adequate for use in exurban areas that consist of heterogeneous mosaics of land uses where habitat fragmentation already exists and not all parcels are available for preservation. This paper presents a species conservation framework that expands upon traditional reserve site selection models in three ways. First, because of the focus on exurban areas, the framework used here allows for land conversion within core habitat patches. Second, the framework provides a more robust assessment of connectivity among patches by accounting for land-use heterogeneity in the dispersal matrix. And third, the framework explicitly incorporates species population dynamics. We apply our conservation framework to the case of pond-breeding salamanders in an exurban community in Rhode Island, USA. Comparisons are made between the outcomes for uniform conservation policies and more flexible policies that accommodate ecological and economic heterogeneity. As expected, policies that offer more flexibility in the decision-making process are less costly in terms of foregone development. Conservation planners should consider core habitat patches, dispersal matrix, and spatial scale in their decision making. By not assessing the potential impact of dispersal barriers, reserve site selection models will result in conservation plans that may not protect species over the long term, particularly for species residing in highly fragmented landscapes such as those found in many exurban communities.},

Consequently, these external effects on biodiversity need to be considered explicitly in economic models, which is only partly reflected in the literature. So far, biodiversity is mostly treated only implicitly in multiple renewable resource models, or it is considered in terms of (genetic) variability or species richness only, but not in terms of indices that simultaneously account for species richness and evenness. However, both constitute important dimensions of biodiversity. This paper integrates such biodiversity indices into an optimal control model, thus accounting for non-use values derived from the existence of multiple living resources. Main findings include that a unique equilibrium satisfying sufficient optimality conditions can be determined although the biodiversity index is non-concave. Compared to a model setup with a monotonically increasing, concave utility function, steady state stocks are distributed more evenly and biodiversity is higher but the total number of individuals is lower when the biodiversity index is applied.},

To address the dynamic dimension of the problem we consider tradable development rights as the instrument of choice. A particular challenge in applying tradable development rights is that the conservation benefit of an individual habitat patch depends on its spatial relationship with other habitat patches and thus is an emergent rather than a fixed property. We analyse with a conceptual model the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitats in a region under a tradable development rights market that takes spatial interaction of habitats explicitly into account. In our analysis two different outcomes may emerge depending on the levels of spatial interaction and cost heterogeneity: an "ordered" structure where habitat patches are clustered in space and are stable over time, and a "disordered" structure where habitat patches are scattered in space and subject to high turnover of destruction and recreation. A high level of spatial interaction or a low level of cost heterogeneity favours an ordered structure while a low level of spatial interaction or a high level of cost heterogeneity favours a disordered structure.},

Trading the service of conservation requires one to define a metric that determines the extent to which a conserved site adds to the regional conservation objective. Yet, while markets for conservation are widely discussed and increasingly applied, little research has been conducted on explicitly accounting for spatial ecological processes in the trading. In this paper, we use a coupled ecological-economic simulation model to examine how spatial connectivity may be considered in the financial incentives created by a market-based conservation scheme. Land use decisions, driven by changing conservation costs and the conservation market, are simulated by an agent-based model of land users. On top of that, a metapopulation model evaluates the conservational success of the market. We find that optimal spatial incentives for agents correlate with species characteristics such as the dispersal distance, but they also depend on the spatio-temporal distribution of conservation costs. We conclude that a combined analysis of ecological and socio-economic conditions should be applied when designing market instruments to protect biodiversity},

   abstract = {Safeguarding biodiversity has been one of the most important issues in environmental and forest policies since the 1990s. In Southern Finland, decisions concerning further actions for the preservation of forest biodiversity will be made in the coming years. To support policy making, we present a multi-regional model that is applicable in determining the economically optimal regional allocation of conservation sites. Three habitat quality models are evaluated to calculate habitat quality indices used as a surrogate for a biodiversity value in a forest sector model. The scenarios presented provide information about the economic impacts of conservation choices on the forest sector. The overall economic impacts of conservation depend on its scale and regional allocation. Conserving land with high biodiversity value can have less adverse impact on the forest sector than conservation of typical commercial forest sites. When optimizing conservation set-asides, we found that set-asides targeted to certain regions possessing higher/lower than average relative share of ecologically valuable land, caused lower/higher adverse economic impacts on the forest sector. Because it is expensive to search land suitable for conservation, these regions could be respectively favoured/avoided when asking forest owners to offer their land for the new conservation program in Southern Finland, which will be based on voluntariness.},

One option to insure against future budget uncertainty is to save money. To maximise the long-term survival of the endangered species, it has to be decided in each period whether to spend the available money now or to allocate it to future use. The paper provides an ecological-economic model for this stochastic dynamic optimisation problem. The findings include that the available money should be allocated as evenly as possible among periods, which may require some precautionary saving in early periods to take uncertainty into account. Under certain conditions, however, increasing uncertainty may at least temporarily increase the optimal payment. Among other parameters, the amount of precautionary actions depends on the magnitude of natural variation in the species population.},

A theoretical bio-economic model is used to derive a hypothesis about the effect of the state of biodiversity on the optimal crop output both in the longer run and in the transitional path towards the steady-state equilibrium. The hypothesised positive relationship between biodiversity stock and optimal levels of crop output is empirically tested using a stochastic production frontier approach, based on data from a panel of UK specialised cereal farms for the period 1989-2000. The results support the theoretical hypothesis. Increases in biodiversity can lead to a continual outward shift in the output frontier (although at a decreasing rate), controlling for the relevant set of labour and capital inputs. Agricultural transition towards biodiversity conservation may be consistent with an increase in crop output in already biodiversity-poor modern agricultural landscapes.},

A site selection framework is used for choosing the habitat-protection strategy that maximizes biodiversity subject to an upper bound on funding with six alternative conservation goals. By using Finnish data on old-growth forests, we found that alternative conservation goals yield different benefit-cost tradeoffs. Goals relying on complementarity between protected stands result in great marginal costs at a high conservation level. Therefore, under these conditions it may not be economically efficient to establish a large conservation network to protect all species in a given area. In contrast, a large conservation network is more likely to be justified when the habitat-protection strategy focuses on species abundance. The trade-offs between alternative objectives are explicitly measured by incrementally varying the weights given to the species. We found that the targets for all species representation and species abundance can largely be met simultaneously. Protecting red-listed species reduces overall species coverage and species abundance particularly at low budget levels.},

Given that both the costs and the benefits of biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures are subject to spatial variation, the criterion of cost-effectiveness calls for spatially heterogeneous compensation payments. However, when deciding whether to implement uniform or heterogeneous compensation payments, the regulator has to compare the disadvantage of uniform payments in terms of cost-effectiveness with the disadvantages of spatially heterogeneous payments. To help resolve this issue, this paper provides a simple ecological-economic model that allows the reduced cost-effectiveness associated with uniform payments for biodiversity-enhancing land-use measures to be assessed for different types of benefit and cost functions.},

We examine optimal conservation decisions given that a biodiversity loss is irreversible and that future use values are uncertain. While species substitutability has been shown to reduce the value of diversity, we show that the flexibility associated with substitutability is a source of value. Marginal species value is decreasing in the number of species, but rising and convex in the value of the marginal species. As we show in the two-species homogenous model, increased volatility raises biodiversity value, and a positive correlation between species values both reduces the value of the pool of species and the value of biodiversity. The role played by the correlation between the value of a species and the value of other species, is reminiscent of the Beta of a financial asset. Just like an asset with a negative Beta derives additional value by providing insurance against fluctuations in the market portfolio, a species whose value tends to move in the opposite direction as the species in use derives additional value from its higher probability to be available for substitution if the value of the species in use diminishes.},

Both fixed costs and administrative constraints are empirically important sources of nonconvexity in tropical rainforests. The former is more important when the nontimber product is carbon sequestration, while the latter is more important when the nontimber product is biodiversity protection.

As a result, the distinction between resource and pest species has become blurry. We propose an economically-based classification of species based on a multi-use bioeconomic model. The classification of the steady state population of a species is shown to depend on both species' density and economic factors. We extend earlier work on multi-use (resource-pest) species by applying the theoretical model to a developing country context where property rights to wildlife are imperfectly enforced, so that second-best trade measures are often applied by the international community to promote conservation. Upon calibrating the model using data for the African elephant, we derive three further results. First, when comparing the optimal stock of a multi-use species to the open access stock, we find that the ranking in terms of abundance is ambiguous. Second, and consistent with existing literature on resource management in a second-best world, our case study supports the idea that trade bans have ambiguous effects on wildlife abundance. Third, due to a bifurcation effect characterizing the multi-use model's solution, strategic and temporary subsidizing by the North may enable them to free ride on conservation efforts of the South henceforth.},

An important consideration is determining whether the spread, or dispersal, of the invading species in turn affects the location and movement of the resident species in the pre-existing habitat, or whether the interspecific competition occurs solely in the same habitat area without diffusive movement of either species, or finally, whether both species dispersal and some form of interspecific competition might occur as a result of an invasion.},

   abstract = {This article develops a model of wild-resource exploitation that includes both the standard bioeconomic properties of growth and harvesting and a species-area relationship linked to habitat conversion. The model is developed for both a closed and an open economy. In the closed-economy model the characteristics of the long-run equilibrium are analysed in three versions of the model: the basic bioeconomic model, the inclusion of habitat conversion and the addition of biodiversity value. In the case of the open-economy model, we also examine the potential effects of trade interventions on the optimal exploitation of species and habitat conversion in the long run. The results confirm that the inclusion of habitat conversion as well as biodiversity value in a model of wild-resource exploitation yields significantly different outcomes than a basic bioeconomic model.

   abstract = {Extinction defines a loss in biodiversity. An established economic model suggests that extinction can be avoided, even in common property settings, if the initial stock is sufficiently large that price and cost evolve to a non-extinction equilibrium. Alternatively, privatization has been suggested as a means to avoid extinction. The empirical validity of these conclusions are investigated by studying the collapse of two species that signaled the end of the United States frontier-the passenger pigeon and the buffalo. The historical studies suggest that the theoretical possibility of a non-extinction equilibrium is unlikely to hold in practice. Similarly, while privatization in a single species context may appear feasible, in a multi-species context the apparent profitability of privatization may be superseded and the species driven to extinction. The latter conclusion also depends on species-specific characteristics of minimum viable population size and habitat requirements.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a benchmark stochastic endogenous growth model of an agricultural economy. Producing food requires land, and increasing the share of total land devoted to farming mechanically reduces the share of land devoted to biodiversity conservation. However, safeguarding a greater number of species guarantees better ecosystem services, which in turn ensure lower volatility of agricultural productivity. The optimal conversion/conservation rule is explicitly characterized. Value of biodiversity is considered in its function of hedging against the volatility of agricultural production. Two aspects of biodiversity's value are examined. We first consider the total value of biodiversity as the welfare gain from biodiversity conservation, that is, the percentage increase in consumption that the society is willing to accept to give up the optimal level of biodiversity in favor of no biodiversity at all. We then consider the insurance value of biodiversity, extending the usual concepts to our stochastic dynamic framework, defining the insurance value of biodiversity as the change of the risk premium due to a marginal change in the level of biodiversity. To highlight the impact of risk on the optimal decision as in the value of biodiversity, we use the Epstein-Zin-Weil specification of preferences and represent preferences by a recursive utility function. This allows us to disentangle the effects of risk aversion and aversion to fluctuations. Thus, the preference for some rather uncertain outcomes and the propensity to smooth consumption over time are represented by two distinct parameters, and the effect of each of them are studied.},

We consider economic management of an ecosystem for a Tilman model of mechanistic resource-based species competition where the growth of species is limited by resource availability. We analyze the equilibrium ecosystem state resulting from Nature's equilibrium, and two basic management problems: the privately optimal management problem and the socially optimal management problem. Under private optimization agents do not take into account externalities associated with the effects of their management practices on ecosystem service flows, while these effects are accounted for at the socially optimal management. We show that in general three different equilibrium species specialization patterns emerge, we completely characterize these patterns for the ecologicalreconomic model with linear structure, and we provide policy rules so that the privately optimal state could be driven toward the socially-optimal or the natural equilibrium. We also develop an approach for unifying equilibrium price theory with Tilman ecological modeling and we prove the existence and analyze the stability of a price equilibrium for a stochastic discrete choice model of species specialization. Finally we discuss equilibrium specialization and policy issues for a generalized model where species and resources interact among themselves, as a conceptual basis for incorporating detailed ecological modeling into economic management.},

   abstract = {Biodiversity is today threatened by many factors of which destruction and reduction of habitats are considered most important for terrestrial species. One way to counteract these threats is to establish reserves with restrictions on land use and exploitation. However, very few reserves can be considered islands, wildlife species roam over large expanses , often via some density dependent dispersal process. As a consequence, habitat destruction, and exploitation, taking place outside will influence the species abundance inside the conservation area. The paper presents a theoretical model for analyzing this type of management problem. The model presented allows for both the common symmetric dispersal as well as what is called asymmetric dispersal between reserve and outside area. The main finding is that habitat destruction outside may not necessarily have negative impact upon the species abundance in the reserve. As a consequence, economic forces working in the direction of reducing the surrounding habitat have unclear effects on the species abundance within the protected area. We also find that harvesting outside the reserve may have quite modest effect on the species abundance in the reserve. This underlines the attractiveness of reserves from a conservation viewpoint.},

   abstract = {Reconciling biodiversity conservation and food production may require the fine-tuning of both agricultural intensity and its spatial allocation. Here, we explored whether the optimization of allocation of intensity could improve food production and biodiversity outcomes. We developed a spatially explicit, multi-criteria optimization model for agricultural intensity allocation at the scale of France and at the resolution of small agricultural regions (SARs) with a mean area of 669.6 km2. Three thousand allocations were randomly simulated and then optimized under three scenarios: intensification, extensification, and reallocation. Optimization was based on food production and biodiversity outcomes using several metrics, such as habitat specialization and trophic level, that reflect the composition of farmland bird communities. The optimization was based on derived statistical relationships between intensity and the production and biodiversity metrics at the SAR scale using national agricultural statistics and bird census data. Simulations showed that optimal allocations modulated the trade-off among criteria and led to increased efficiency, with optimal extensification increasing biodiversity and minimizing production losses. Furthermore, we revealed “win-no loss” solutions. For example, optimal intensification increased production with almost no biodiversity loss and optimal reallocation benefited biodiversity with almost no cost to production. A variety of agricultural intensity levels were necessary to maintain a diversity of farmland bird communities at the national scale. Although we demonstrate that optimal allocation of intensity can be a powerful means of reconciling diverse criteria at the national scale, its implementation will require new mechanisms for spatially targeted and coordinated policies.},

   abstract = {This study presents an optimal harvesting model for the semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) and its main winter energy source, ground lichens (Cladonia spp.). Females are divided into 17 age classes and males into 13. Reproduction is specified by a modified harmonic mean mating function and an age-specific reproduction success. Lichen availability determines individuals' overwinter weight decrease, natural mortality, the number of calves per females and calves' birth weight. The reindeer herding cooperative can choose the number of animals harvested from the 30 age/sex classes and is assumed to maximize the preset value of net income. The structured optimization model is solved as a fully dynamic system and for initial states that may not be close to the optimal steady state. This enables to study optimal recovery from overgrazed pastures and the optimality of the constant escapement policy. We show that given zero interest rate the optimal steady-state lichen density is less than 50\% of the maximum sustainable yield level but nearly twice as high as empirically observed. Density dependence at optimal equilibrium is realized in calf weight and in the average number of calves per female. Optimal slaughtering is concentrated on six-month-old calves. Adult females are slaughtered at the age of 9.5 years and males at the age of 5.5 years. A moderate or high interest rate increases the steady state reindeer population but decreases pasture conditions. Dynamic solutions deviate from constant escapement, implying that the optimal recovery from initially overgrazed pastures is slower than suggested in existing studies and actual policy. The shadow value for males is three times higher than for females.},

This paper presents a formal model of pest management which allows the selection of a program containing elements of both the sustained harvest and eradication alternatives.

The economic model incorporates information from a model of the predator-prey system, and the particular program chosen depends upon characteristics of the predator-prey system such as "stability" and "non-vulnerability".},

Under artificial regeneration, the result is the reverse. Economically optimal solutions with a 20-year harvesting interval produce an annual sawn timber output of 4.4-2.4 m 3·ha -1 depending on thermal zone and interest rate.

In contrast with the classic inverted J-structure, optimal steady-state size structure resembles a serrate form. Profitability of even- and uneven-aged management is compared assuming that the initial stand state represents an optimal uneven-aged steady state. A switch to even-aged management is optimal given the most favorable growth conditions and interest rate below 1\%-2\%.

Extensive demographic studies were used for developing a model of the population in the reserve area, as well as for the hunting area. The chamois in the reserve has value for tourism and conservation, whereas the chamois outside the reserve has mainly hunting value. Optimal management of the overall system consisting of reserve and hunting areas depends on the management objective: either a simple maximization of the value of hunted chamois, or the value of hunted chamois together with the value of the chamois in the reserve. We explored how optimal harvesting strategies are affected by the relative hunting values of the sexes and the relative nonconsumptive values of the chamois inside the reserve. A male-biased, sex-specific harvesting rate was generally found to be optimal, a bias which was larger when the value of the chamois in the reserve was included. Movement rates and sex ratio play critical roles in such systems, and should therefore be studied more than they typically are.

This paper studies the relationship between predation mortality and natural mortality, when food availability affects natural mortality of the livestock. Semi-domestic Saami reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) herding in Norway is used as a case study. When predation affects reindeer density, food competition among reindeer changes, which changes weights and natural mortality in the reindeer population. An age-structured bio-economic model is presented, where this relationship is taken into account. While predation mortality may be additional to natural mortality in absence of food limitation, it can compensate for natural mortality in situations of food scarcity. Furthermore, due to density dependency in livestock weights, predation may increase the meat value of livestock. The paper analyzes how predation affects livestock production and economic performance under an optimized management scheme. One main result is that predation shifts the optimal harvesting composition towards calf harvesting and, therefore, the optimal stock composition among the different categories of animals. This contrasts findings in the existing bioeconomic literature. Furthermore, a changing harvesting pattern towards calf harvest is an important adjustment that highly limits the negative impact on profit of predation.},

Different management actions reduce the impact of invasions differently: preventing invasion eliminates impacts entirely, surveillance can facilitate early detection and eradication, and removing individuals can reduce future impact. Few studies have examined the trade-off between all three facets of invasion management. Using a simple model of island invasion, we find how resources should be allocated to each action to minimise the total cost of management and impact. We use a case study of black rat (Rattus rattus) invasion on Barrow Island, Western Australia. The optimal amount to invest in each management action depends on the effectiveness of each action, and the magnitude of impact caused by different stages of invasion. If the pest is currently absent, it is more cost-effective to prevent impacts through prevention or surveillance. If the pest is already widespread, it can sometimes be cost-effective to give up rather than attempting eradication. This model of invasion can provide useful decision support by identifying the trade-offs inherent in each candidate management strategy, the thresholds that alter optimal strategies, and the parameters for which we need more information.},

The red deer population is structured in five categories of animals (calves, female and male yearlings, adult females and adult males).

In the numerical illustration it is shown that the optimal harvest pattern stays quite stable under various parameter changes.

One conflict is due to wolf predation on livestock, especially sheep and reindeer. Another is predation on wild ungulates. As the wolves have shown a strong preference for moose (Alces alces) in this respect, a smaller moose population is available for game hunting. The cost of increased moose predation by wolves is examined using a two-step process. First, we analyse the costs to landowners, comprising the loss of animals potentially available for hunting less the reduction in browsing damage associated with a smaller moose population. Second, we examine the problem from a broader point of view, where costs external to landowners and local communities are included. By far the most important cost here is damage related to collisions between moose and motor vehicles.},

In the model there are two agents: a park agency managing a national park of fixed size and a group of agropastoralists living in the vicinity of the park. The park authority produces tourism services and sells hunting licences, whereas the agropastoralists produce livestock products. Wildlife and livestock interact with each other and wildlife is a nuisance for livestock production. The conflict is analysed under different market solutions as the agropastoralists, to various degrees, are given profit shares from the park activities. It is demonstrated that a market solution where they are given property rights in the form of a fixed share of the harvesting profit, will increase the nuisance on their production and therefore generally give no clear welfare gain for the local people. On the other hand, if they also receive a profit share from the tourist activity above that of the hunting benefit, the nuisance from the roaming wildlife will decrease as this scheme gives incentives for the park manager to increase the offtake and thereby decrease the wildlife stock in the long term. There will therefore be more livestock and a clear welfare gain for the agropastoralists compared to the situation where they have no property rights. Under certain conditions, the stock sizes will also be closer to what is optimal from an overall point of view.},

An ecological population model is presented and used as a basis for the economic analyses carried out at the village level using data from Tanzania. This model incorporates both density-dependent and density-independent (stochastic) factors. Rodents are controlled by applying poison, and the costs are made up of the cost of poison plus the damage to maize production. We analyse how the present-value costs of maize production are affected by various rodent control strategies, by varying the duration and timing of rodenticide application. Our numerical results suggest that it is economically beneficial to control the rodent population. In general, the most cost-effective duration of controlling the rodent population is 3-4 months every year, and especially at the end of the dry season-beginning of rainy season. The paper demonstrates that changing from today's practice of symptomatic treatment when heavy rodent damage is noticed to a practice where the calendar is emphasized, may substantially improve the economic conditions for the maize producing farmers. This main conclusion is highly robust and not much affected by changing prices of maize production.},

   abstract = {Environmental weeds are plants that invade natural ecosystems and present a serious threat to conservation of nature. Environmental weeds have been implicated in the extinction of several indigenous plant species, and they also threaten ecosystem stability and functional complexity. Historically, emphasis in weed control in Australian national parks has been placed on chemicals, manual pulling of small plants, excluding tourists and feral animal control measures. Recently, biological control has been introduced to control weed infestations. These methods typically have been applied as funds have become available, with little opportunity to consider their long-term effectiveness. As the threat from environmental weeds is becoming more fully recognised, an integrated, strategic, ecological and economic approach to weed management is needed. A deterministic dynamic programming model is developed for this purpose in this paper. A case study for scotch broom is presented, to assess the ways in which this approach can address the policy issues that face the community in the management of an environmental weed in a national park. The model takes account of the weed population dynamics, the effectiveness and cost of control measures, and the value of the park outputs (biodiversity, recreation and grazing). The dynamic programming model includes weed density and seed bank as state variables and a budget constraint for the control variables. The model is used to derive optimal control rules for any given state of the weed population. An optimal decision rule provides a package of control measures that can be used to attack the problem each year, depending on the current weed density and seed bank. Optimal trajectories are developed for a planning horizon of 45 years, and the effect of the budget constraint is analysed. The marginal value of an extra dollar for weed control, in terms of discounted future benefits, is estimated. It is shown that a combination of controls that targets both weed density and the seed bank is important. It is also shown (given the assumed parameters) that biological control is worth undertaking, as it appears as part of most of the optimal strategies identified. The paper concludes with policy recommendations for managing weeds in natural ecosystems.},

Location Global and South Africa. Methods We developed a decision analysis framework to analyse the best management goal for an invasive species population (eradication, containment or take no action) when knowledge about the current extent is uncertain. We used value of information analysis to identify when investment in learning about the extent will improve this decision-making and tested the sensitivity of the conclusions to different parameters (e.g. spread rate, maximum extent, and management efficacy and cost). The model was applied to Acacia paradoxa DC, an Australian shrub with an estimated invasive extent of 310ha on Table Mountain, South Africa. Results Under the parameters used, attempting eradication is cost-effective for infestations of up to 777ha. However, if the invasion extent is poorly known, then attempting eradication is only cost-effective for infestations estimated as 296ha or smaller. The value of learning is greatest (maximum of 8\% saving) when infestation extent is poorly known and if it is close to the maximum extent for which attempting eradication is optimal. The optimal management action is most sensitive to the probability that the action succeeds (which depends on the extent), with the discount rate and cost of management also important, but spread rate less so. Over a 20-year time-horizon, attempting to eradicate A. paradoxa from South Africa is predicted to cost on average ZAR 8 million if the extent is known, and if our current estimate is poor, ZAR 33.6 million as opposed to ZAR 32.8 million for attempting containment. Main conclusions Our framework evaluates the cost-effectiveness of attempting eradication or containment of an invasive population that takes uncertainty in population extent into account. We show that incorporating uncertainty in the analysis avoids overly optimistic beliefs about the effectiveness of management enabling better management decisions. For A. paradoxa in South Africa, attempting to eradicate is likely to be cost-effective, particularly if resources are allocated to better understand and improve management efficacy.},

   abstract = {Methods for designing regional reserve networks mostly concentrate on providing maximal representation of species occurring in the region. Representation-based methods, however, typically consider a static snapshot of species incidences, and the spatial dynamics of the species are ignored. It has been empirically demonstrated that reserves designed using representation do not guarantee another important goal of reserve design: long-term persistence. The question studied here is the following: Which subset of sites do you select to maximize the long-term persistence of a species living in a metapopulation, given that each site has a cost and the amount of resource (e.g., money) available is limited? We present an optimization method, which uses a combination of evolutionary optimization (a genetic algorithm) and local search to find the optimal selection of sites. The quality of each candidate solution is evaluated using a spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. The proposed method is applied to a metapopulation of the false heath fritillary butterfly, an endangered species in Finland. With this data set, the proposed estimation method produces intuitively acceptable and consistent results within minutes of computation time. Sites favored by the algorithm are located in three patch clusters, and they tend to be inexpensive and initially occupied. Expensive and/or very isolated patches are rarely selected into the optimal site selection.},

   abstract = {Much effort in systematic conservation planning has gone into devising measures and algorithms which are efficient at capturing the biological importance of different candidate areas. While cost is at the theoretical heart of complementarity based analyses, little empirical attention has been paid to explicitly incorporating cost into conservation planning. Here we begin to address this gap by utilising the first estimate of management costs for ecoregion conservation across the entire African continent to examine the consequences of incorporating estimates of management costs into conservation planning. We apply a recently developed equation linking empirical costs data to economic indicators and the size distribution of reserves to estimate the annual funding required to effectively manage reserve networks covering 10\% of each of Africa's 118 ecoregions. Our estimates suggest that US\$630 M/ year (0.1\% of African Gross National Income) would achieve this goal. However, within this the costs per ecoregion vary widely. Analysis of this variation in cost emphasises that high costs are likely to be correlated with high endemism or threat and that focussing exclusively on cheap areas is unlikely to achieve conservation goals. We also used the cost estimates to examine the potential for improving cost-effectiveness in conservation planning by comparing cumulative representation of vertebrate species and the associated management cost of reserves under different prioritisation schemes where cost was included or excluded. We found that factoring the cost of conservation management into the planning process results in a marked increase in the cost effectiveness of a given prioritisation scheme. This suggests that further improvements in systematic conservation planning are more likely to come more from measuring and integrating cost and other socio-economic considerations than from focusing exclusively on refinement of biological criteria.},

Trees were divided into shade-tolerant, intermediate, and shade-intolerant species in twelve diameter classes. Model predictions were tested against post-sample observations for short-term (15-year) and long-term (steady-state) accuracy. This growth model was then applied to study stand growth dynamics with and without management. Starting with the current average stand state, the predicted stand basal area of an unmanaged stand rose steadily to a maximum, dropped gradually, and finally reached a steady state. The time paths of basal area and tree size diversity were highly and positively correlated. Instead, tree species diversity decreased when size diversity and basal area increased, and vice-versa. When harvesting was introduced, it was found that more intensive harvest increased the diversity of tree species, while decreasing the diversity of tree size. A 20-year cutting cycle could produce higher economic returns than a 10-year cutting cycle, with similar size and species diversity. Harvesting most of the saw timbers every 20 years could be a good compromise between economics and tree diversity, at the stand level.},

   abstract = {The destruction of natural habitats for agricultural production results in local biodiversity loss. Biodiversity loss in turn affects agricultural production indirectly through a range of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. Land conversion thus results in a negative externality, mediated by changes in biodiversity. When the consequences of this externality are delayed in time, lack of internalization results in overshoot-and-collapse dynamics, which are undesirable from a sustainability perspective. Here, we emphasize the importance of forward-looking policies for the long-term sustainability of human–nature interactions. We show that the internalization of this externality through a land tax can result in several win-win effects in the long run. First, more biodiversity is preserved at equilibrium, which increases the carrying capacity and total well-being of the human population. Second, a taxation path that maximizes the discounted sum of human utilities prevents or greatly alleviates overshoot-and-collapse crises, thus increasing the sustainability of the system. In particular, this result holds in the case of imperfect information regarding the precise temporal dynamics of biodiversity loss, suggesting that the design of efficient land-use management policies is possible despite incomplete ecological data. This study highlights the need to internalize biodiversity-dependent externalities through economic incentives, especially under uncertainty regarding long-term ecological dynamics.},

   abstract = {The problem of rangeland rnanagement is modeled as a stochastic control problem. The manager periodically chooses stocking rates and decides whether to use a treatment which improves the rangeland. His decisions have ah uncertain impact on the rangeland. The theory offinite Markov chains is used to analyze the solution to the control problern. The stochastic specification of the model is varied to test the sensitivity of the optimal policies. These are quite robust except at certain levels of the range conditiort. Cases of a risk-neutral and risk-averse manager are studied. Rangeland management requires making decisions in an uncertain environment. These decisions affect future opportunities as well as current profits. Two important decisions are how often to apply a treatment which improves the range and how heavily to stock the range, Standard economic analysis of range management is based on the response curve technique developed by Workman, Tefertiller, and Leinweber. The response curve gives the expected productivity of the range over time for a gŸ set of management policies; the corresponding cash flows are determined by partial budgeting analysis. Alternative policies are compared using measures of net present value or internal rate of return (Scifres et al., Whitson and Scifres). Burt (1971) studied the optimal frequency of treatment using dynamic programming. Pope and McBryde used qua-dratic programming to determine optimal frequency of treatment and yearly stocking rates. These models are deterministic. The chief contribution of the current study is its inclusion of both dynamic and stochastic elements of the manager's problem. Determination of the stocking rate and frequency of treatment is modeled as a stochastic control problem and solved using linear programming. The sensitivity of the optimal rules and expected returns to different stochastic specifications is investigated. The theory of finite Markov chains, which has not previously been used in this context, provides a means of determining expected time between treatments and unconditional expected values of the rangeland. These statistics summarize important features of the model and offer a convenient way of comparing different specifications. The methodology is outlined and then applied to rangelarld in southeastern Texas. Suppose that the manager has two types of decisions which must be made at yearly intervals. He decides whether to apply a treatment which improves the quality of the rangeland and chooses the yearly stocking rate (animal units per 640 acres). The frequency of the treatments, annual stocking rates, and range conditions affect the range condition in future years. This is the source of the dynamics. The payoff in any year is a function of the stocking rate and range condition of that year and whether the treatment is used. The manager seeks to maximize the expectation of the present value of the sum of either yearly profits of of the utility of profits. The dynamics that relate the current stocking rate and range condition to future range condition is the principal source of uncertainty. This is because of the inadequacy of ecological models of rangeland dynamics and the inherent uncertainty caused by weather and other uncontrollable forces. A simple de-terministic equation for rangeland dynamics, which corresponds to descriptions by range scientists, is used as a starting point. The de-terministic optimal control problem is solved subject to this constraint. Uncertainty is then introduced into the dynamic equation, and the resulting stochastic control problem is solved.},

   abstract = {The sustainability of coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) hinges on their long-term ecological dynamics. Land conversion generates extinction and functioning debts, i.e. a time-delayed loss of species and associated ecosystem services. Sustainability theory, however, has not so far considered the long-term consequences of these ecological debts on SESs. We investigate this question using a dynamical model that couples human demography, technological change and biodiversity. Human population growth drives land conversion, which in turn reduces biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services to agricultural production (ecological feedback). Technological change brings about a demographic transition leading to a population equilibrium. When the ecological feedback is delayed in time, some SESs experience population overshoots followed by large reductions in biodiversity, human population size and well-being, which we call environmental crises. Using a sustainability criterion that captures the vulnerability of an SES to such crises, we show that some of the characteristics common to modern SESs (e.g. high production efficiency and labor intensity, concave-down ecological relationships) are detrimental to their long-term sustainability. Maintaining sustainability thus requires strong counteracting forces, such as the demographic transition and land-use management. To this end, we provide integrative sustainability thresholds for land conversion, biodiversity loss and human population size - each threshold being related to the others through the economic, technological, demographic and ecological parameters of the SES. Numerical simulations show that remaining within these sustainable boundaries prevents environmental crises from occurring. By capturing the long-term ecological and socio-economic drivers of SESs, our theoretical approach proposes a new way to define integrative conservation objectives that ensure the long-term sustainability of our planet.},

This model is used to investigate how to allocate limited resources between activities before and after the first discovery of an invasive species and the effects of the characteristics of an invasive species on limited resource allocation. The optimality conditions show that it is economically efficient to spend a larger share of outlays for exclusion activities before, rather than after, a species is first discovered, up to a threshold point. We also find that, after discovery, more exclusionary measures and fewer control measures are optimal, when the pest population is less than a threshold. As the pest population increases beyond this threshold, the exclusionary measures are no longer optimal. Finally, a comparative dynamic analysis indicates that the efficient level of total expenditures on preventive and control measures decreases with the level of the invasive species stock and increases with the intrinsic population growth rate, the rate of additional discoveries avoided, and the maximum possible pest population.},

Hence, contrary to what is argued for in the literature, handing the property rights over to the local people means not automatically more wildlife and a more "sustainable" resource utilization.

EDRR consists of search activities beyond the ports of entry, where search (and potentially removal) efforts are targeted toward areas where credible evidence suggests the presence of an invader. EDRR costs are a spatially dependent variable related to the ease or difficulty of searching an area, while damages are assumed to be a population-dependent variable. A myopic strategy in which search only occurs when and where current expected net returns are positive is attractive to managers, and, we find, significantly lowers present value losses (by \$270 m over 30 years). We find further that in the tradeoff between search costs and damages avoided, early and aggressive measures that search some high priority areas beyond points of entry even when current costs of search exceed current damages can save the island more (\$295 m over 30 years).

We apply this model to a simple application with three possible levels of infestation where the decision-maker can choose to take no action, only monitor, only treat, or do both monitoring and treatment jointly. We solve for optimal management as a function of beliefs about the level of infestation. For a case with positive monitoring and treatment costs, we find that the optimal policy involves choosing no action when there is a sufficiently large probability of no infestation, monitoring alone with intermediate probability values and treatment alone when the probability of moderate or high infestation is large. We also show how optimal management and expected costs change as the cost or quality of information from monitoring changes. With costless and perfect monitoring, expected costs are 20-30\% lower across the range of belief states relative to the expected costs without monitoring.},

   abstract = {Government agencies develop invasive species management programmes assuming early detection is key to successful management. Some theoretical studies confirm this intuition, while others, which restrict sampling effort to be constant in time, suggest managers are investing too heavily in sampling to detect new local invader populations. We explore whether these optimal constant-effort strategies underplay the importance of early surveillance and determine how much changing sampling effort through time reduces total management costs. Using optimal control theory to calculate time-dependent surveillance policies that minimize the total cost of sampling, eradication, and damage by the invasive, we find that the best strategies often use intense early sampling, followed by reduced sampling effort. Intense early sampling can drastically reduce costs compared with constant-effort strategies if propagule pressure from outside the managed area is low. However, if new infestations arise from frequent independent introductions from an outside source, constant strategies are cost-effective. Synthesis and applications. For invasive species that are initially present, not frequently reintroduced into the managed area, and for which surveillance is reasonably cost-effective, we recommend a simple three-phase management programme that deploys intense early surveillance until the majority of undetected populations have been discovered, followed by medium effort until most of the heavily infested areas have been cleared of the invader and finally low long-term effort to prevent infestations caused by future introductions and spread from populations that escaped surveillance. This programme captures the majority of the economic benefits from varying sampling effort continuously through time.},

For that purpose we construct an integrated model of the economy and the ecosystem with explicit consideration of nonhuman species and with competition between human and nonhuman species for land and prey biomass. We characterize and compare the efficient allocations when social welfare is anthropocentric (only consumers have positive welfare weights), when social welfare is biocentric (only nonhuman species have positive welfare weights) and when social welfare is nonanthropocentric (all species have positive welfare weights). Not surprisingly, biocentric social welfare calls for suspending all economic activities. It is more important, however, that both anthropocentrism and nonanthropocentrism make the case for nature protection through different channels, though. Our analysis suggests that one may dispense with the concept of nonanthropocentric social welfare provided that in the anthropocentric framework the consumers' intrinsic valuation of nature is properly accounted for.},

Indeed, vector-borne diseases represent a significant portion of emerging diseases. We compare and contrast three strategic approaches to managing a vector-borne pathogen: Conventional strategies based on disease ecology without regard to economic tradeoffs and cost-effective strategies based on a bioeconomic framework. Conventional strategies entail managing the vector population below a threshold value based on R0-the basic reproductive ratio of the pathogen, which measures a pathogen's ability to invade uninfected systems. This does not account for post-infection dynamics, nor does it balance ecological and economic tradeoffs. Thresholds take on a more profound role under a bioeconomic paradigm: Rather than unilaterally determining vector control choices, thresholds inform control choices and are influenced by them. Simulation results show cost-effective strategies can lower overall program costs and may be less sensitive to parameter estimation.},

   abstract = {Accidental introductions of nonindigenous invasive species impair ecosystems, increase the risk of native species extinctions, and cause substantial economic damages on a worldwide basis. Despite the magnitude of the problem, very little economic analysis has been focused on this topic to date. This manuscript develops an optimal control model of the management of a nonindigenous species stock following its introduction and establishment. We find that the influence of changes in ecological and human factors (such as the invader's intrinsic growth rate, carrying capacity, and the effectiveness of invasive species management technologies) on the optimal level of management are analytically (mathematically) ambiguous in sign and depend on the values of other parameters and variables. To estimate actual numerical solutions to the model and conduct sensitivity analyses, we construct a case study illustration based on invasive plant species on arid lands. The illustration shows that the optimal level of management effort is sensitive to biological and ecological factors (the stock's intrinsic rate of growth, the carrying capacity afforded the invasive species, and the form of the invader's growth function) that are species-and site-specific as well as uncertain given currently available scientific information. This highlights the need for better collaboration and information transfer between economists and scientists interested in this topic. Given that resources for addressing nonindigenous species threats typically are quite constrained, and complete eradication in a particular area is often technically infeasible, the model provides useful insight on optimal levels of ongoing management and how they may vary according to bioeconomic factors.},

Dynamic simulations allow us to find numerically the optimal effort of weed control over a 5-year time horizon under a variety of beginning infestation levels. In a base-case scenario without governmental cost-share of control costs, we find that efforts to control the weed are not profitable. The base-case scenarios also indicate that grazing contributes to giving the invasive weed a competitive edge. A second series of simulations include incentive payments for weed control which are set at the minimum level required to have a net positive impact on the rancher's profitability. From these simulations, we find that the level of infestation impacts the size of the incentive necessary to get the agent to control the weeds and that the incentive payments impact the level of effort of the rancher. In addition, results reveal that the higher incentive payments for lower levels of weed infestations reduce the total cumulative incentive payments over time. Efficient policies directed towards management of invasive weeds may need to be adjusted for each individual case.},

The optimal policy includes both subsidies for control of an invasive species with zero commercial value, and harvesting taxes on the resident species which are adjusted in the presence of an invasion. A numerical age-structured optimization model is used to analyze the role of species’ life history, i.e. the degree of evolutionary specialization in survival or reproduction, for the choice of strategy and the associated economic instruments. Results show that, irrespective of life history, both policies are implemented in efficient solutions, but subsidies for controlling the invader are used to a larger extent when it is possible to target specific age classes of the invader. If a resident species is harvested non-selectively, the optimal subsidy for control of the invader is lower, and if the invader is specialized in survival the control subsidy mirrors the resident species harvest cycle.},

The size of habitat determines the diversity and abundance of species. That biodiversity generates, in turn, a flow of ecosystem services with public-good characteristics for human consumption. The ecosystem submodel yields (rather than assumes!) population growth functions with each species' growth depending on the size of habitat. First the relationship between habitat and species growth (sustenance, decline and extinction) is explored. The laissez-faire economy is shown to result in an underprovision of habitat making the case for land use restrictions for nature protection. The optimal land use policy is characterized with full regard of ecosystem dynamics. Finally, labor-augmenting technical change is introduced to generate ever increasing pressure towards further habitat reductions. In the laissez-faire economy the habitat is consequently squeezed to zero in the long-run so that all species are doomed. Social optimality demands, however, to refrain from using all land for economic purposes despite ever growing labor productivity.},

   abstract = {Ecologists usually argue for a proactive approach to species conservation-it should start before a species is endangered and under substantial risk of extinction. In reality, however, conservation often only starts when species populations are already in a critical state. This may be the result of a policy process in which those actors who see only little or no benefits from conserving species try to delay conservation as long as possible to avoid its cost. A frequent consequence is that populations decline to critical levels so that once conservation policies set in due to legal obligations, political pressure or any other reason, additional conservation measures are required to re-establish the populations. We show that the costs associated with this policy process may be higher than those of a proactive policy. This is somewhat surprising because the costs of maintaining populations at a level at which they are not endangered may occur over a longer period. However, the costs of bringing species populations back to those levels may be so high that they outweigh the costs of the proactive approach. We develop simple cost functions that capture the main economic and ecological parameters relevant to our argument and apply them for an assessment of the costs of common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) conservation in the region of Mannheim, Germany. We find that a proactive approach would have saved between 17.2 and 36.4 mn compared to the existing policy where conservation was delayed until legal requirements forced local policy makers to implement a comprehensive hamster protection programme.},

During recent attempts to discuss biological diversity, economists have drawn upon the tools and techniques of mainstream resource economics to estimate the values of species. This can lead to a tendency to focus on the importance of species in isolation to one another and on the numbers of species (species richness) in natural areas. Such an approach does not incorporate the ongoing efforts of scientists to define and analyze different types of diversity among species and natural systems (e.g., genetic diversity and ecosystem diversity). Rather than address the explicit valuation of individual species or of biological diversity, we show how potential guidelines for the allocation of conservation expenditures among regions might be changed by consideration of the "genetic distinctiveness" of species, in addition to the numbers of species, inhabiting those regions. We use recent estimates of inter-species genetic distances originating from DNA-DNA hybridization as an example of the kind of weighted information that could prove useful in conservation planning, and as an illustration we examine crane ranges in Africa and Asia.},

	abstract = {Empirical work often uses treatment assigned following geographic boundaries. When the effects of treatment cross over borders, classical difference-in-differences estimation produces biased estimates for the average treatment effect. In this paper, I introduce a potential outcomes framework to model spillover effects and decompose the estimate's bias in two parts: (1) the control group no longer identifies the counterfactual trend because their outcomes are affected by treatment and (2) changes in treated units' outcomes reflect the effect of their own treatment status and the effect from the treatment status of 'close' units. I propose conditions for non-parametric identification that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing. To highlight the importance of spillover effects, I revisit analyses of three place-based interventions.},

Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual firm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 firms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This "granular" hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior of large firms. This paper's ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the fluctuations of other economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance.},

We also find that the optimal harvest rule may include closure of some areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent basis (biological reserves). Reserves alone cannot correct open access, but may, under sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity, increase profits if appropriate harvest controls are in place outside of reserves.},

The population structure is characterized in a manner consistent with modern biological ideas that stress patchiness, heterogeneity, and interconnections among and between patches. Generally, we find the equilibrium patterns of biomass and effort across the system to be dependent upon bioeconomic conditions within each patch and the nature of the biological dispersal mechanism between patches. We use simple examples to illustrate how the distribution of effort throughout the system reflects the heterogeneity and the spatial biological linkages.},

We then derive the efficient estimator addressing this challenge, which takes an intuitive "imputation" form when treatment-effect heterogeneity is unrestricted. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Our method applies with time-varying controls, in triple-difference designs, and with certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of our results in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the United States, we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11 percent in the first quarter - about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models - and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.},

This approach implicitly assumes that the distribution of the policy effect is constant across units and over time. Yet many environmental policies have effects that differ depending on the unit exposed to the policy and the period in which the policy is applied. In this setting we detail why the model parameters generally do not capture a useful measure of the effects. We then show that in a multiperiod setting, if the policy is applied in only one period, then the model parameters do capture a useful measure of the effects. In these settings, appropriate inference is based on cluster-robust standard errors. Because the resultant t-statistic may yield unreliable inference when clusters are heterogeneous, we present an appropriate measure of cluster heterogeneity and describe how the measure should be used to guide inference.},

We show that they estimate weighted sums of the average treatment effects (ATE) in each group and period, with weights that may be negative. Due to the negative weights, the linear regression coefficient may for instance be negative while all the ATEs are positive. We propose another estimator that solves this issue. In the two applications we revisit, it is significantly different from the linear regression estimator.},

I decompose the TWFE estimator to show that it is a weighted sum of five different types of two-by-two comparisons, with positive weights. I show that parallel trends assumptions on either the untreated or treated potential outcomes must hold for each comparison to identify the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the group switching treatment status, when the effect of the treatment is contemporaneous. Both parallel trends assumptions are thus necessary and sufficient for the TWFE estimator to weigh each ATE positively, when allowing treatment effects to be heterogeneous across groups and periods. I further provide sufficient conditions under which the TWFE estimator remains valid even in the presence of dynamic treatment effects. Finally, I show how to exploit all available comparisons to build unbiased estimators of the ATT and ATE.},

We begin by articulating a simple set of “canonical” assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on (i) multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, (ii) potential violations of parallel trends, or (iii) alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

We start by assuming that the data only has two time periods. We also assume that from period one to two, the treatment of some units, the switchers, changes, while the treatment of other units, the stayers, does not change. Then, our estimators compare the outcome evolution of switchers and stayers with the same value of the treatment at period one. Our estimators only rely on parallel trends assumptions, unlike commonly used two-way fixed effects regressions that also rely on homogeneous treatment effect assumptions. Comparing switchers and stayers with the same period-one treatment is important: unconditional comparisons of switchers and stayers implicitly assume constant treatment effects over time. With a continuous treatment, switchers cannot be matched to stayers with exactly the same period-one treatment, but comparisons of switchers and stayers with the same period-one treatment can still be achieved by non-parametric regression, or by propensity-score reweighting. We extend our results to applications with no stayers, more than two time periods,  and where the treatment may have dynamic effects.},

The metapopulation harvesting theory is applied to a hypothetical fishery and optimal strategies are compared to harvesting strategies that assume the metapopulation is composed either of single unconnected populations or of one well-mixed population. Local populations that have high per capita larval production should be more conservatively harvested than would be predicted using conventional theory.

Managers must make difficult decisions to find efficient ways to expend limited resources across large and complex landscapes amidst substantial uncertainty regarding effective treatment strategies, climates, and invader-induced novel processes. Coupled empirical and process-based models can simulate the effects of management activities, quantify potential management costs and ecological impacts, while considering uncertainties associated with climate, spread rates, and wildfires lacking historical precedent. We developed a state-and-transition simulation model coupled with a fire behavior model to study impacts to native biodiversity and fire regimes in a national park invaded by a perennial grass. We evaluated resources required to meet management objectives, and efficient and effective spatial allocation of those resources. Management strategies and ecological scenarios strongly influenced the ability to minimize potential invasion impacts. Adding aerial precision spot spraying, which can target low cover levels in remote regions, may be enough to conserve the desert ecosystem from small scale transformation through invasive competition and from broad functional transformations through invasive-induced fire regime changes. Spot spraying may also be beneficial if wetter monsoonal conditions create faster invader growth rates when likelihoods of achieving management goals decreases even with unlimited resources. Given current park budgets with the addition of spot spraying, management goals may be achievable regardless of spatial prioritization. Our techniques could be applied to other situations to evaluate conservation goal feasibility and determine actions that would be most efficient in meeting those goals.},

We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit.},

	abstract = {Dispersal drives invasion dynamics of nonnative species and pathogens. Applying knowledge of dispersal to optimize the management of invasions can mean the difference between a failed and a successful control program and dramatically improve the return on investment of control efforts. A common approach to identifying optimal management solutions for invasions is to optimize dynamic spatial models that incorporate dispersal. Optimizing these spatial models can be very challenging because the interaction of time, space, and uncertainty rapidly amplifies the number of dimensions being considered. Addressing such problems requires advances in and the integration of techniques from multiple fields, including ecology, decision analysis, bioeconomics, natural resource management, and optimization. By synthesizing recent advances from these diverse fields, we provide a workflow for applying ecological theory to advance optimal management science and highlight priorities for optimizing the control of invasions. One of the striking gaps we identify is the extremely limited consideration of dispersal uncertainty in optimal management frameworks, even though dispersal estimates are highly uncertain and greatly influence invasion outcomes. In addition, optimization frameworks rarely consider multiple types of uncertainty (we describe five major types) and their interrelationships. Thus, feedbacks from management or other sources that could magnify uncertainty in dispersal are rarely considered. Incorporating uncertainty is crucial for improving transparency in decision risks and identifying optimal management strategies. We discuss gaps and solutions to the challenges of optimization using dynamic spatial models to increase the practical application of these important tools and improve the consistency and robustness of management recommendations for invasions.},

Expansion of the railroad network may have affected all counties directly or indirectly—an econometric challenge that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on each county is captured by changes in that county’s “market access,” a reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory. We measure counties’ market access by constructing a network database of railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in 1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land by 60\%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country roads.},

	abstract = {The difference-in-differences (DID) estimator is one of the most popular tools for applied research in economics to evaluate the effects of public interventions and other treatments of interest on some relevant outcome variables. However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated. That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated. In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies with changes in observed characteristics.},

We begin with two observations: i) standard quasi-experimental methods, first applied in other microeconomic fields, typically assume unit-level treatments that do not spill over across units; (ii) because public goods, such as environmental attributes, exhibit externalities, treatment of one unit often affects other units. To explore the implications of applying standard quasi-experimental methods to public good problems, we extend the potential outcomes framework to explicitly distinguish between unit-level source and the resulting group-level exposure of a public good. This new framework serves as a foundation for reviewing and interpreting key papers from the recent empirical literature. We formally demonstrate that two common quasi-experimental estimators of the marginal social benefit of a public good can be biased due to externality spillovers, even when the source of the public good itself is quasi-randomly assigned. We propose an unbiased estimator for the valuation of local public goods and discuss how it can be implemented in future studies. Finally, we consider how to preserve the advantages of the quasi-experimental approach when valuing global public goods, such as climate change mitigation, for which no control units are available.},

We illustrate some implications for the case where the research design takes advantage of variation across units (say, US states) in exposure to some treatment (say, a policy change). In this case, the TWFE can fail to estimate the average (or even a weighted average) of the units’ coefficients. Under some conditions, there exists no estimator that is guaranteed to estimate even a weighted average. Building on the literature, we note that when there is a unit totally unaffected by treatment, it is possible to estimate an average effect by replacing the TWFE with an average of difference-in-differences estimators.},

Wildfire policy has increased its focus on integrating fire suppression with risk mitigation through fuel reduction. In this context incentives to elicit management activities that mitigate fire risk are critical, because landowners may not carry out sufficient risk mitigation on their own. We examine the effectiveness and welfare implications of several incentive policies, including two novel approaches not studied in the context of wildfire management: liability rules and voluntary agreements. Our analysis uses a threshold model of public good provision, which allows for each landowner's mitigation choices to depend on the total amount of mitigation in the landscape. Our results suggest that the risk mitigation threshold is critical in determining the effectiveness and welfare effects of different incentive programs. When the threshold is high, only voluntary agreements and cost sharing can increase mitigation effort and welfare. Negligence standards can also be effective and welfare enhancing but only when the mitigation threshold is sufficiently low.},

The variation method fails in this case due to the fact that the filtration is not fixed. To overcome the difficulty, we use the orthogonal decomposition of the state process to write the cost functional as the sum of two parts: one is a functional of the control and the filtering process and the other part is independent of the choice of the control. The first part possesses a mathematical structure similar to the full information problem. By completing the square, it is shown that the optimal control is given by a feedback representation via the filtering process. The optimal value is also obtained explicitly.},

Diamond (1997) famously argued that “fractured land” was responsible for China’s tendency toward political unification and Europe’s protracted polycentrism. We build a dynamic model with granular geographical information in terms of topographical features and the location of productive agricultural land to quantitatively gauge the effects of fractured land on state formation in Eurasia. We find that topography alone is sufficient but not necessary to explain polycentrism in Europe and unification in China. Differences in land productivity, in particular the existence of a core region of high land productivity in northern China, deliver the same result. We discuss how our results map into observed historical outcomes, assess how robust our findings are, and analyze the differences between theory and data in Africa and the Americas.},

The joint link surplus function allows arbitrary, bounded heterogeneity in the benefit to forming links. Under decreasing returns to scale in link surplus, the set of Nash equilibria is well-behaved. In contrast, with constant or increasing returns to scale, heterogeneity and returns to self-investment limit the set of Nash equilibria. This model rationalizes equilibrium networks in which individuals simultaneously hold ties that are asymmetric and of varying intensity.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is fundamental in determining biodiversity responses to rapid climate change, but recently acquired ecological and evolutionary knowledge is seldom accounted for in either predictive methods or conservation planning. We emphasise the accumulating evidence for direct and indirect impacts of climate change on dispersal. Additionally, evolutionary theory predicts increases in dispersal at expanding range margins, and this has been observed in a number of species. This multitude of ecological and evolutionary processes is likely to lead to complex responses of dispersal to climate change. As a result, improvement of models of species’ range changes will require greater realism in the representation of dispersal. Placing dispersal at the heart of our thinking will facilitate development of conservation strategies that are resilient to climate change, including landscape management and assisted colonisation. Synthesis This article seeks synthesis across the fields of dispersal ecology and evolution, species distribution modelling and conservation biology. Increasing effort focuses on understanding how dispersal influences species' responses to climate change. Importantly, though perhaps not broadly widely-recognised, species' dispersal characteristics are themselves likely to alter during rapid climate change. We compile evidence for direct and indirect influences that climate change may have on dispersal, some ecological and others evolutionary. We emphasise the need for predictive modelling to account for this dispersal realism and highlight the need for conservation to make better use of our existing knowledge related to dispersal.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores evolved behaviors and life-history traits that conferred resilience to environmental disturbances at various temporal and spatial scales. We synthesize empirical information for each large carnivore species in the Rocky Mountains regarding three basic mechanisms of resilience at different hierarchical levels: (1) behavioral plasticity in foraging behavior that ameliorates flux in food availability, (2) demographic compensation that mitigates increased exploitation, and (3) dispersal that provides functional connectivity among fragmented populations. With their high annual productivity and dispersal capabilities, wolves (Canis lupus) possess resiliency to modest levels of human disturbance of habitat and populations. Cougars (Puma concolor) appear to have slightly less resiliency because of more specific requirements for stalking habitat and lower biennial productivity. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) possess much less resiliency because of their need for quality forage in spring and fall, their low triennial productivity, and the strong philopatry of female offspring to maternal home ranges. Based upon limited information, wolverines (Gulo gulo) appear more susceptible to natural fluctuations in scavenging opportunities and may have lower lifetime productivity than even grizzly bears. By accelerating the rate and expanding the scope of disturbance, humans have undermined the resiliency mechanisms of large carnivores and have caused widespread declines. Both the resiliency profiles and the historical record attest to the need for some form of refugia for large carnivores. With their productivity and dispersal capability, wolves and cougars might respond adequately to refugia that are well distributed in several units across the landscape at distances scaled to successful dispersal (e.g., less than five home range diameters). With their lower productivity and dispersal capability, grizzly bears and wolverines might fare better in a landscape dominated by larger or more contiguous refugia. Refugia must encompass the full array of seasonal habitats needed by large carnivores and should be connected to other refugia through landscape linkages.},

We propose that biodiversity provides spatial insurance for ecosystem functioning by virtue of spatial exchanges among local systems in heterogeneous landscapes. We explore this hypothesis by using a simple theoretical metacommunity model with explicit local consumer–resource dynamics and dispersal among systems. Our model shows that variation in dispersal rate affects the temporal mean and variability of ecosystem productivity strongly and nonmonotonically through two mechanisms: spatial averaging by the intermediate-type species that tends to dominate the landscape at high dispersal rates, and functional compensations between species that are made possible by the maintenance of species diversity. The spatial insurance effects of species diversity are highest at the intermediate dispersal rates that maximize local diversity. These results have profound implications for conservation and management. Knowledge of spatial processes across ecosystems is critical to predict the effects of landscape changes on both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and services.},

One hypothesized mechanism is landscape connectivity, a habitat configuration that allows movement of biotic and abiotic resources between local patches. Whether connectivity increases all or only one of resistance, resilience, and recovery has not been teased apart, however, and has been difficult to test at large scales and for complex trophic webs. Natural microcosms offer a complex system that can be manipulated to test questions at a landscape-scale relative to the community of study. Here, we test the role of connectivity in altering resistance, resilience, and recovery to a gradient of heating disturbance in moss microcosms. To test across trophic levels, we focused on community composition as our metric of response and applied three connectivity treatments – isolation, connected to an equally disturbed patch, and connected to an undisturbed patch. We found that connectivity between equally disturbed patches boosted resistance of communities to disturbance. Additionally, recovery was linear and rapid in communities connected to undisturbed landscapes, hump shaped when connected to equally disturbed landscapes, and linear but slow in isolated communities. We did not find thresholds on the disturbance gradient at which disturbed communities exhibited zero or increasing dissimilarity to controls through time, so were unable to draw conclusions on the role of connectivity in ecological resilience. Ultimately, isolated communities exhibited increasingly variable composition and slow recovery patterns even in control communities when compared with connected treatments.},

Extensive information on local constraints is already available, but few studies consider the landscape context when planning restoration actions. We propose a multiscale framework based on the landscape attributes of habitat amount and connectivity to infer landscape resilience and to set priority areas for restoration. Landscapes with intermediate habitat amount and where connectivity remains sufficiently high to favor recolonization were considered to be intermediately resilient, with high possibilities of restoration effectiveness and thus were designated as priority areas for restoration actions. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) quantifying habitat amount and connectivity; (2) using landscape ecology theory to identify intermediate resilience landscapes based on habitat amount, percolation theory, and landscape connectivity; and (3) ranking landscapes according to their importance as corridors or bottlenecks for biological flows on a broader scale, based on a graph theory approach. We present a case study for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (approximately 150 million hectares) in order to demonstrate the proposed method. For the Atlantic Forest, landscapes that present high restoration effectiveness represent only 10\% of the region, but contain approximately 15 million hectares that could be targeted for restoration actions (an area similar to today's remaining forest extent). The proposed method represents a practical way to both plan restoration actions and optimize biodiversity conservation efforts by focusing on landscapes that would result in greater conservation benefits.},

For example, planners might design a linkage between two conserved areas, or the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity might set targets for a well-connected system of protected areas for each nation. Here we describe 35 metrics that can quantify connectivity of focal patches or of networks and monitor changes over time in an ecoscape (landscape or seascape). The connectivity metrics fall into four categories: (1) structural connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-nonspecific spatial functions, (2) connectivity metrics derived from binary maps and species-specific population sizes and dispersal functions (3) metrics derived from multi-state maps and species responses to those states, and (4) metrics of functional connectivity reflecting observed flow of organisms or genes. We provide a decision tree to select which of these metrics are most appropriate for a given conservation goal and broad ecoscape context. Functional connectivity metrics may be preferred if conservation is focused on particular species or if data are available to parameterize models for a suite of species that represent needs of the focal biota. However, with climate change, ecoscapes need to facilitate movements of all species that need to adapt by shifting their ranges. Because an intact network of relatively natural areas may support movement for many species, structural metrics that consider the human footprint should be used in all coarse filter approximations of functional connectivity in shared ecoscapes.},

We review both the ecological and economic concepts developed in restoration ecology, and offer guidance on when, what, where, and how to restore ecosystems. For when to restore, we highlight the value of pursuing restoration early to prevent ecosystems from crossing tipping points and evaluating whether unassisted natural recovery is more cost-effective than active restoration. For what to restore, we encourage developing a restoration plan with stakeholders that will restore structural, compositional, and functional endpoints, and whose goal is a more resistant and resilient ecosystem. For where to restore, we emphasize developing restoration approaches that can address the impediment of rural poverty in the developing world and identifying and then balancing the ecosystems and regions in most need of restoration and those that are best positioned for restoration success. For the economics of how to restore ecosystems, we review the advantages and disadvantages of market-based strategies, such as environmental insurance bonds and Payment for Ecosystem Services frameworks, for funding, incentivizing, and ensuring restoration. For the ecology of how to restore ecosystems, we discuss the value of taking into account various ecological theories, site history, and landscape and aquascape perspectives, and employing a more inclusive toolbox that holistically considers alterations to propagule pressure, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions. Finally, we draw attention to the importance of monitoring; adaptive management; stakeholder involvement; collaborations among scientists, managers, and practitioners; formal evaluation throughout the restoration process; and integrating ecological and economic concepts to maximize restoration success. We hope this overview of key ecological and economic concepts in restoration science sheds light on the discipline and facilitates restoring and maintaining the services and products provided by natural capital, thus improving human livelihoods and hope for posterity.},

	abstract = {Connectivity of habitat patches is thought to be important for movement of genes, individuals, populations, and species over multiple temporal and spatial scales. We used graph theory to characterize multiple aspects of landscape connectivity in a habitat network in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A). We compared this landscape with simulated networks with known topology, resistance to disturbance, and rate of movement. We introduced graph measures such as compartmentalization and clustering, which can be used to identify locations on the landscape that may be especially resilient to human development or areas that may be most suitable for conservation. Our analyses indicated that for songbirds the Piedmont habitat network was well connected. Furthermore, the habitat network had commonalities with planar networks, which exhibit slow movement, and scale-free networks, which are resistant to random disturbances. These results suggest that connectivity in the habitat network was high enough to prevent the negative consequences of isolation but not so high as to allow rapid spread of disease. Our graph-theory framework provided insight into regional and emergent global network properties in an intuitive and visual way and allowed us to make inferences about rates and paths of species movements and vulnerability to disturbance. This approach can be applied easily to assessing habitat connectivity in any fragmented or patchy landscape. /// Se piensa que la conectividad de los parches de hábitat es importante para el movimiento de genes, individuos, poblaciones y especies en múltiples escalas temporales y espaciales. Utilizamos la teoría de gráficos para caracterizar múltiples aspectos de la conectividad del paisaje en una red de hábitats en el Pie de Monte en Carolina del Norte (E.U.A.). Comparamos este paisaje con redes simuladas con topología, resistencia a la perturbación y tasa de desplazamiento conocidas. Introdujimos medidas gráficas como la compartimentación y el agrupamiento, que pueden ser utilizados para identificar localidades en el paisaje que pueden ser especialmente resilientes al desarrollo humano o áreas que pueden ser más adecuadas para la conservación. Nuestros análisis indicaron que la red de hábitats en el Pie de Monte estaba bien conectada para las aves. Más aun, la red de hábitats tenía características en común con las redes en planicies, que exhiben desplazamiento lento y con redes sin escalas, que son resistentes a las perturbaciones aleatorias. Estos resultados sugieren que la conectividad en la red de hábitats fue suficiente para prevenir las consecuencias negativas del aislamiento pero no para permitir la rápida dispersión de enfermedades. Nuestro marco de referencia teórico-gráfico proporcionó entendimiento de las propiedades regionales y globales de las redes de manera intuitiva y visual y nos permitió inferir las tasas y direcciones de los movimientos de las especies y su vulnerabilidad a la perturbación. Este método se puede aplicar fácilmente a la evaluación de la conectividad del hábitat en cualquier hábitat fragmentado.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity indicators are increasingly used to assess progress towards conservation targets. Particular indicators are required to assess the impacts of habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity and biodiversity value. This paper recognises that connectivity is best defined by the interaction between species and the landscape in which they occur, and proposes a functional approach to assess connectivity. The approach utilises an incidence function model (IFM) as a spatially explicit method to assess potential species-level connectivity. The standard IFM connectivity measure is modified to account for the influence of the surrounding landscape matrix on edge impacts (through a weighted internal edge buffer) and ecological isolation (through an assessment of least-cost distance to account for landscape permeability). It has been recognised that such patch-based connectivity measures can provide misleading results when used to examine change, as they only focus on between patch movements. As a result, a modified hybrid IFM, based on a combination of patch and cell-based approaches, is developed to account for both within (intra) and between (inter) patch connectivity. The resulting probability of functional connectivity (PFC) indicator was evaluated, alongside a patch-based connectivity measure, through the application to four model landscapes based on changes (2 negative and 2 positive) to a control landscape. The four model landscapes illustrate the impact of landscape change on habitat area, edge impacts and matrix permeability. The proposed PFC indicator successfully discriminated between the two negative and the two positive changes to the control landscape, whereas, the patch-based connectivity measure detected change successfully within three of the four landscapes. The PFC indicator predicted a decrease in intra and inter-patch connectivity following habitat loss and fragmentation (negative change 1), whereas patch-based connectivity measures indicate an increase in connectivity between fragmented patches. The proposed PFC indicator offers the opportunity to take the necessary species-based perspective to examine functional connectivity, incorporating habitat preference, dispersal probability, edge impacts and ecological isolation/permeability. The urgency to assess changes in connectivity and support conservation policy means that there is little time to wait for more complete data. We believe the proposed approach provides a robust balance between the data required and the biologically meaningful indicator produced.},

Thus, there is an increasing interest in considering connectivity in landscape planning and habitat conservation. In this context, graph structures have been shown to be a powerful and effective way of both representing the landscape pattern as a network and performing complex analysis regarding landscape connectivity. Many indices have been used for connectivity analyses so far but comparatively very little efforts have been made to understand their behaviour and sensitivity to spatial changes, which seriously undermines their adequate interpretation and usefulness. We systematically compare a set of ten graph-based connectivity indices, evaluating their reaction to different types of change that can occur in the landscape (habitat patches loss, corridors loss, etc.) and their effectiveness for identifying which landscape elements are more critical for habitat conservation. Many of the available indices were found to present serious limitations that make them inadequate as a basis for conservation planning. We present a new index (IIC) that achieves all the properties of an ideal index according to our analysis. We suggest that the connectivity problem should be considered within the wider concept of habitat availability, which considers a habitat patch itself as a space where connectivity exists, integrating habitat amount and connectivity between habitat patches in a single measure.},

Tropical forests harbour among the highest levels of terrestrial species diversity and are likely to experience rapid land-use change in the coming decades. Synthetic analyses of observed responses of species are useful for quantifying how land use affects biodiversity and for predicting outcomes under land-use scenarios. Previous applications of this approach have typically focused on individual taxonomic groups, analysing the average response of the whole community to changes in land use. Here, we incorporate quantitative remotely sensed data about habitats in, to our knowledge, the first worldwide synthetic analysis of how individual species in four major taxonomic groups—invertebrates, ‘herptiles’ (reptiles and amphibians), mammals and birds—respond to multiple human pressures in tropical and sub-tropical forests. We show significant independent impacts of land use, human vegetation offtake, forest cover and human population density on both occurrence and abundance of species, highlighting the value of analysing multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Responses differ among the four groups considered, and—within birds and mammals—between habitat specialists and habitat generalists and between narrow-ranged and wide-ranged species.},

We present a novel method for selecting reserve systems that maximize persistence across multiple species, subject to a conservation budget. We use a spatially explicit metapopulation model to estimate extinction risk, a function of the ecology of the species and the amount, quality and configuration of habitat. We compare our new method with more traditional, area-based reserve selection methods, using a ten-species case study, and find that the expected loss of species is reduced 20-fold. Unlike previous methods, we avoid designating arbitrary weightings between reserve size and configuration; rather, our method is based on population processes and is grounded in ecological theory.},

With increasing complexity and vividness in the network analysis problems, there is a need to modify the existing traditional centrality measures. Weighted centrality measures usually consider weights on the edges and assume the weights on the nodes to be uniform. One of the main reasons for this assumption is the hardness and challenges in mapping the nodes to their corresponding weights. In this paper, we propose a way to overcome this kind of limitation by hybridization of the traditional centrality measures. The hybridization is done by taking one of the centrality measures as a mapping function to generate weights on the nodes and then using the node weights in other centrality measures for better complex ranking.},

The framework includes an area-based target for the protection of 30\% of lands and seas globally—through well-connected systems of protected areas. Although the field of connectivity science has grown rapidly, limited progress has been made in tracking conservation connectivity in practice. This is in part due to the lack of a standardizing framework to clarify different purposes, approaches, and datasets—particularly in differentiating a metric from its application within a broader connectivity framework—as well as a benchmark to quantitatively compare alternative approaches. To address this science-practice gap, we developed a novel metric of connectivity called the Protected Network metric (ProNet). ProNet is designed to assess the structural connectivity of a protected area network in a way that can be easily described, clearly communicated, and rapidly computed at high resolution. We evaluated how ProNet adheres to fundamental conservation science principles using a library of hypothetical landscapes, compared it to two commonly used existing connectivity metrics, and demonstrated its performance in assessing connectivity for a set of real-world landscapes selected across the gradient of human modification. More broadly, ProNet is a powerful tool to galvanize emerging connectivity conservation as a countermeasure to increasing fragmentation of global ecosystems.},

	abstract = {One way to reduce the impacts of invading wildlife diseases is setting up fences that would reduce the spread of pathogens by limiting connectivity, similarly to exclusion fences that are commonly used to conserve threatened species against invasive predators. One of the problems with fences is that, while they may have the short-term benefit of impeding the spread of disease, this benefit may be offset by potential long-term ecological costs of fragmentation by fencing. However, managers facing situations where a pathogen has been detected near the habitat of a (highly) vulnerable species may be willing to explore such a trade-off. To aid such exploration quantitatively, we present a series of models trading off the benefits of fragmentation (potential reduction of disease impacts on susceptible individuals) against its costs (both financial and ecological, i.e. reduced viability in the patches created by fragmentation), and exploring the effects of fragmentation on non-target species richness. For all model variants we derive the optimal number of artificial patches. We show that pre-emptive disease fences may have benefits when the risk of disease exceeds the impacts of fragmentation, when fence failure rates are lower than a specific threshold, and when sufficient resources are available to implement optimal solutions. A useful step to initiate planning is to obtain information about the expected number of initial infection events and on the host’s extinction threshold with respect to the focal habitat and management duration. Our approach can assist managers to identify whether the trade-offs support the decision to fence and how intensive fragmentation should be.},

	abstract = {The conservation of many threatened species can be advanced by the eradication of alien invasive animals from islands. However, island eradications are an expensive, difficult and uncertain undertaking. An increasingly common eradication strategy is the construction of ‘interior fences’ to partition islands into smaller, independent eradication regions that can be treated sequentially or concurrently. Proponents argue that, while interior fences incur substantial up front construction costs, they reduce overall eradication costs. However, this hypothesis lacks an explicit theoretical or empirical justification. We formulate a general theory that relates the number of interior fences to the magnitude and variation of the economic cost of island eradication. We use this theory to explore the conditions under which interior fences represent a defensible management strategy, under cost and risk minimisation objectives. We then specifically consider the forthcoming eradication of cats Felis catus from Dirk Hartog Island, Western Australia, by parameterising our general theory using published data on the cost and success of previous projects. Our results predict that under a wide range of reasonable conditions, interior fences can reduce the expected cost of a successful invasive alien animal eradication from large islands. On Dirk Hartog Island, interior fences will marginally reduce eradication costs, with two fences reducing expected costs by 3\%. Interior fences have a much more substantial effect on the variability of eradication costs: two fences reduce the width of the 95\% confidence bounds by more than one-third and halve the size of the average project cost overrun/underrun. Our results reveal that the construction of interior fences is a defensible management strategy for eradicating alien invasive species from islands. However, the primary benefit of interior fences will be risk management, rather than a reduction in expected project costs.},

	abstract = {Almost all metapopulation modelling assumes that connectivity between patches is only a function of distance, and is therefore symmetric. However, connectivity will not depend only on the distance between the patches, as some paths are easy to traverse, while others are difficult. When colonising organisms interact with the heterogeneous landscape between patches, connectivity patterns will invariably be asymmetric. There have been few attempts to theoretically assess the effects of asymmetric connectivity patterns on the dynamics of metapopulations. In this paper, we use the framework of complex networks to investigate whether metapopulation dynamics can be determined by directly analysing the asymmetric connectivity patterns that link the patches. Our analyses focus on “patch occupancy” metapopulation models, which only consider whether a patch is occupied or not. We propose three easily calculated network metrics: the “asymmetry” and “average path strength” of the connectivity pattern, and the “centrality” of each patch. Together, these metrics can be used to predict the length of time a metapopulation is expected to persist, and the relative contribution of each patch to a metapopulation's viability. Our results clearly demonstrate the negative effect that asymmetry has on metapopulation persistence. Complex network analyses represent a useful new tool for understanding the dynamics of species existing in fragmented landscapes, particularly those existing in large metapopulations.},

	abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists have used many measures of landscape structure1,2,3,4,5 to predict the population dynamic consequences of habitat loss and fragmentation6,7,8, but these measures are not well justified by population dynamic theory. Here we introduce a new measure for highly fragmented landscapes, termed the metapopulation capacity, which is rigorously derived from metapopulation theory and can easily be applied to real networks of habitat fragments with known areas and connectivities. Technically, metapopulation capacity is the leading eigenvalue of an appropriate ‘landscape’ matrix. A species is predicted to persist in a landscape if the metapopulation capacity of that landscape is greater than a threshold value determined by the properties of the species. Therefore, metapopulation capacity can conveniently be used to rank different landscapes in terms of their capacity to support viable metapopulations. We present an empirical example on multiple networks occupied by an endangered species of butterfly. Using this theory, we may also calculate how the metapopulation capacity is changed by removing habitat fragments from or adding new ones into specific spatial locations, or by changing their areas. The metapopulation capacity should find many applications in metapopulation ecology, landscape ecology and conservation biology.},

	abstract = {The identity of an individual patch as a source or a sink within a metapopulation is a function of its ability to produce individuals and to disperse them to other patches. In marine systems patch identity is very often defined by dispersal ability alone—upstream patches are sources—while issues of variable habitat quality (which affects local production) are ignored. This can have important ramifications for the science of marine reserve siting. This study develops a spatially explicit source–sink metapopulation model for reef fish and uses it to evaluate the relative importance of connectivity versus demography and how this depends upon the level of local larval retention and the strength of density-dependent recruitment. Elasticity analyses indicated that patch contribution (source or sink) was more sensitive to demographic parameters (particularly survival) than connectivity and this effect was conserved even under strong levels of density-dependence and was generally strengthened as local retention increased. Variability in the relationship between parameter elasticity and local retention was shown to be dependent upon the magnitude of connectivity for an individual patch relative to a critical connectivity value. The proportion of larvae lost due to transport processes was an important parameter which directly affected the magnitude of this critical connectivity value. Patches with connectivity values less than the critical value contributed to the metapopulation largely via production (i.e., local demographics most important). As local retention increased, so did the importance of demographic parameters in these patches. Patches with connectivity values greater than the critical value contributed largely via dispersal of larvae and thus the importance of local demographics decreased as local retention increased.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation.},

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing. 1 Click here to view this article's online features: • Download figures as PPT slides • Navigate linked references • Download citations • Explore related articles • Search keywords ANNUAL REVIEWS Further ES48CH01-Fahrig ARI 18 September 2017 16:55 1. HABITAT PATCHINESS Habitat patchiness has been an important concept in ecology for over 80 years, beginning with the observation by Gause (1934) that persistence of predator–prey systems depends on the availability of separate refuges for prey. Huffaker’s (1958) classic predator–prey experiment took this idea another step, showing that division of a food resource into a large number of patches allows a predator–prey system to persist by providing temporary prey refuge sites that move about in space and time, allowing the prey to stay one step ahead of the predators. Levins \& Culver (1971) showed that habitat patchiness can also allow persistence of competing species through a similar dynamic, as long as the better competitor is the worse disperser. And den Boer (1968) showed more generally that habitat patchiness can increase species persistence by spreading the risk of local extinctions. Thus, from 1934 until approximately 1970, habitat patchiness was associated with the concept of habitat spatial heterogeneity and was generally considered to have a positive influence on population and community-level ecological responses. This all changed with Levins’s (1970) extrapolation of the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur \& Wilson 1967) to patches of habitat. From that point to the present, habitat patchiness has been associated with the concept of habitat fragmentation and is generally considered to have a negative influence on population and community-level responses (Villard \& Metzger 2014, Hanski 2015). Although these two major conceptualizations of habitat patchiness seem to make contradictory predictions, the contradiction is not real. In the earlier work, increasing habitat patchiness (or habitat spatial heterogeneity) generally implied an increase in the total amount of habitat available, or at least no decrease. In contrast, in the later work, increasing habitat patchiness (or habitat fragmentation) generally implied a decrease in the total amount of habitat (Figure 1). Therefore, in the former case the positive effect of patchiness is often associated with habitat gain, whereas in the latter case the negative effect of patchiness is associated with habitat loss. Thus, both views of habitat patchiness can represent a positive effect of increasing habitat amount on population and community responses. a 1935 to {\textasciitilde}1970 Patchiness = heterogeneity More patches, more habitat Increasing abundance and diversity},

	abstract = {Most species are imperfectly detected during biological surveys, which creates uncertainty around their abundance or presence at a given location. Decision makers managing threatened or pest species are regularly faced with this uncertainty. Wildlife diseases can drive species to extinction; thus, managing species with disease is an important part of conservation. Devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) is one such disease that led to the listing of the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) as endangered. Managers aim to maintain devils in the wild by establishing disease-free insurance populations at isolated sites. Often a resident DFTD-affected population must first be removed. In a successful collaboration between decision scientists and wildlife managers, we used an accessible population model to inform monitoring decisions and facilitate the establishment of an insurance population of devils on Forestier Peninsula. We used a Bayesian catch-effort model to estimate population size of a diseased population from removal and camera trap data. We also analyzed the costs and benefits of declaring the area disease-free prior to reintroduction and establishment of a healthy insurance population. After the monitoring session in May-June 2015, the probability that all devils had been successfully removed was close to 1, even when we accounted for a possible introduction of a devil to the site. Given this high probability and the baseline cost of declaring population absence prematurely, we found it was not cost-effective to carry out any additional monitoring before introducing the insurance population. Considering these results within the broader context of Tasmanian devil management, managers ultimately decided to implement an additional monitoring session before the introduction. This was a conservative decision that accounted for uncertainty in model estimates and for the broader nonmonetary costs of mistakenly declaring the area disease-free.},

We compare the equilibria in the case of a common resource with those that emerge when the regulator either creates a natural reserve, or assigns Territorial User Rights to the players. We show that, when technological and preference parameters dictate a low harvesting effort, the policies are ineffective in promoting the conservation of the resource and, in addition, they lead to a lower payoff for at least one of the players. Conversely, in a context of higher harvesting effort, the intervention can help to safeguard the resource, preventing extinction while also improving the welfare of both players.},

We highlight important differences between a deterministic approach and our dispersal formalism. Exemplified for a meta-population, our results indicate that the proposed scheme provides a realistic relationship between dispersal rate and extinction thresholds. Furthermore, it enables us to investigate the influence of patch density on meta-population persistence and provides insight on the effects of probabilistic dispersal events on species persistence. Importantly, our formalism makes it possible to capture the transient nature of inter-patch connections, and can thereby provide short term predictions on species distribution, which might be highly relevant for projections on how climate and land use changes influence species distribution patterns.},

Our model has two basic features: the underlying population changes as a result of the actions of both participants, and each participant takes account of the other's actions. This strategic aspect is studied, for an example, by using the concept of a Cournot-Nash equilibrium in which each participant's reaction depends on the stock of fish and not on previous behavior.

A dynamic optimization problem is constructed where economic agents control fixed areas. The growth of the resource occurring in each area disperses. It is shown that the desired stock size for maximizing agents in their own area decreases inversely with the amount of leakage—the degree to which the resource is common. The socially optimal stock in each region is a function of the marginal profit for all areas that receive dispersing organisms, and may be greater than the privately optimal stock for an area if that area captured all of its own resource growth. This effect is enhanced if the dispersal rate is stock dependent, possibly creating a ‘double’ tragedy.

The three management scenarios lead to different optimal behaviors. Property owners exerting unilateral control must leave some wildlife untrapped to generate sufficient population pressure against the flow of continual immigration from neighboring populations. Analysis of the bilateral model indicates that noncooperating neighboring landowners having varying pay-off functions will end up with leaving all wildlife untraped in their parcels.

We analyze the equilibrium ecosystem state resulting from Nature's equilibrium, and two basic management problems: the privately optimal management problem and the socially optimal management problem. Under private optimization agents do not take into account externalities associated with the effects of their management practices on ecosystem service flows, while these effects are accounted for at the socially optimal management. We show that in general three different equilibrium species specialization patterns emerge, we completely characterize these patterns for the ecological/economic model with linear structure, and we provide policy rules so that the privately optimal state could be driven toward the socially-optimal or the natural equilibrium. We also develop an approach for unifying equilibrium price theory with Tilman ecological modeling and we prove the existence and analyze the stability of a price equilibrium for a stochastic discrete choice model of species specialization. Finally we discuss equilibrium specialization and policy issues for a generalized model where species and resources interact among themselves, as a conceptual basis for incorporating detailed ecological modeling into economic management.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread interest in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the southeastern United States, historical deer populations and densities have not been compiled into one accessible source. We digitized maps from 1950, 1970, 1982, and 2003 and reviewed literature to quantify population sizes and densities in the Southeast, although previous estimates may not be accurate. Deer population sizes declined to a minimum of {\textless}215,000 during the early 1900s. Population sizes and mean deer densities were 304,000 and 0.22 deer/km2 by 1940, 476,000 and 0.35 deer/km2 by 1950, 2.9 million to 4.1 million and 2.2 to 3.1 deer/km2 by approximately 1970, 6.2 million and 4.6 deer/km2 by 1982, and 10.8 million to 12 million and 8 to 9 deer/km2 by about 2003. Although our estimates are likely not completely accurate in space and time, due to difficulty of counting animals, they provide the best available information and a range and trend in values, with general corroboration among sources. The current population size may be greater than during pre-Euro-American settlement, when based on minimum historical deer densities, or, conversely, the current population may be within the bounds of mid to high historical deer densities. Large deer densities trigger a research need to evaluate deer effects on vegetation, but threshold densities when deer are damaging to herbaceous plants may need to be reconsidered. Instead, we conjecture that deer may be considered a natural disturbance helpful in controlling increased tree densities during the past century, albeit placing a secondary stress upon declining herbaceous plants, which are losing ground to trees. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Exotic pests are serious threats to North American ecosystems; thus, economic analysis of decisions about eradication, stopping, or slowing their spread may be critical to ecosystem management. We present a model to analyze costs and benefits of altering the spread rates of invading organisms. The target rate of population expansion (which may be positive or negative) is considered as a control function, and the present value of net benefits from managing population spread is the criterion that is maximized. Two local maxima of the present value of net benefits are possible: one for eradication and another for slowing the spread. If both maxima are present, their heights are compared, and the strategy that corresponds to a higher value is selected. The optimal strategy changes from eradication to slowing the spread to finally doing nothing, as the area occupied by the species increases, the negative impact of the pest per unit area decreases, or the discount rate increases. The model shows that slowing population spread is a viable strategy of pest control even when a relatively small area remains uninfested. Stopping population spread is not an optimal strategy unless natural barriers to population spread exist. The model is applied to managing the spread of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations in the United States.},

The three management scenarios lead to different optimal behaviors. Property owners exerting unilateral control must leave some wildlife untrapped to generate sufficient population pressure against the flow of continual immigration from neighboring populations. Analysis of the bilateral model indicates that noncooperating neighboring landowners having varying pay-off functions will end up with leaving all wildlife untraped in their parcels. Under the centralized management scenario, landowners find it most profitable to collectively delegate the control responsibility of an entire watershed to a single manager.},

It is concluded that the social fence as such tends to stabilize population density; hence, if cycles are observed in nature, it seems reasonable, on the basis of the social fence hypothesis, to conclude that the microtine density cycle is driven by the trophic interactions and not by the social fence mechanism. This is also supported by general population theory saying that competition (for space and food) most commonly contributes to population stability rather than acting as a destabilizing factor; trophic interactions on the other hand generally destabilize population density. Analysis of the models suggests that populations for which the social fence always is "open" are expected to exhibit fairly stable densities. On the other hand, populations for which the social fence occasionally "closes", may exhibit regular density cycles if the trophic interactions are of a nature so as to cause density oscillations.},

	abstract = {In this article, I try to establish optimal law enforcement efforts in markets for illegal goods taking into account both consumption and violence externalities. I model competition between firms as a Cournot duopoly game where they produce an illegal good and sabotage each other to gain a larger share of the market. I show that socially optimal law enforcement can result in any of the following corner solutions: letting firms produce freely, partially intervene punishing one firm more than the other, or fully intervene to eliminate them both. Which solution is optimal depends on the size of consumption and violence externalities; the direct costs of law enforcement and sabotage; the weight of profits in the welfare function of the authority; and how cautious is the authority avoiding violence externalities while enforcing the law.},
