	abstract = {Climate strongly influences global wildfire activity, and recent wildfire surges may signal fire weather-induced pyrogeographic shifts. Here we use three daily global climate data sets and three fire danger indices to develop a simple annual metric of fire weather season length, and map spatio-temporal trends from 1979 to 2013. We show that fire weather seasons have lengthened across 29.6 million km2 (25.3\%) of the Earth’s vegetated surface, resulting in an 18.7\% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also show a doubling (108.1\% increase) of global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons ({\textgreater}1.0 σ above the historical mean) and an increased global frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.4 million km2 (53.4\%) during the second half of the study period. If these fire weather changes are coupled with ignition sources and available fuel, they could markedly impact global ecosystems, societies, economies and climate.},

abstract = {This study considers a class of critical node detection problems that involves minimization of a distance-based connectivity measure of a given unweighted graph via the removal of a subset of nodes (referred to as critical nodes) subject to a budgetary constraint. The distance-based connectivity measure of a graph is assumed to be a function of the actual pairwise distances between nodes in the remaining graph (e.g., graph efficiency, Harary index, characteristic path length, residual closeness) rather than simply whether nodes are connected or not, a typical assumption in the literature. We derive linear integer programming (IP) formulations, along with additional enhancements, aimed at improving the performance of standard solvers. For handling larger instances, we develop an effective exact algorithm that iteratively solves a series of simpler IPs to obtain an optimal solution for the original problem. The edge-weighted generalization is also considered, which results in some interesting implications for distance-based clique relaxations, namely, -clubs. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments with real-world and randomly generated network instances under various settings that reveal interesting insights and demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. In particular, one important conclusion of our work is that vulnerability of real-world networks to targeted attacks can be significantly more pronounced than what can be estimated by centrality-based heuristic methods commonly used in the literature. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

When sites cannot all be protected immediately, and excluded sites are threatened by development, planning should factor in both expected biodiversity benefits of sites and development risk. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic integer-programming problem. We find that the timing of selections is critical; conservation budgets available up front yield significantly greater biodiversity protection. We also compare results using optimal and heuristic algorithms. The theory is applied to vertebrate and development threat data from southwestern California.},
